15.txt,"There is a debate over whether university students should be required to attend classes or if it should be optional for them. While both sides have valid arguments, I believe that university students should be required to attend classes.
One argument for making attendance optional is that students are adults and should have the freedom to make their own decisions about their education. They may prefer to learn on their own or through other methods, such as online coursework. Furthermore, some students may have work or other commitments that prevent them from attending classes regularly.
However, there are several reasons why I believe that attendance should be required for university students.
First, attending classes allows students to fully engage in the learning process. In-person classes offer a level of interaction and discussion that cannot be replicated through online coursework. Students have the opportunity to ask questions, participate in group activities, and gain a deeper understanding of the material.
Second, attendance helps to create a sense of community and belonging within the university. By attending classes, students have the opportunity to meet and connect with their peers, which can lead to valuable friendships and support networks.
Third, attendance can improve academic performance. Research has shown that students who attend class regularly tend to have higher grades and a greater sense of accomplishment. This is likely due to the fact that attending class allows students to stay on track with the material and receive timely feedback from their professors.
In conclusion, while there are valid arguments for making attendance optional for university students, I believe that attendance should be required. Attending classes allows students to fully engage in the learning process, creates a sense of community, and can improve academic performance.",0.0,1.0,AI
114.txt,"There is a longstanding debate about the best approach to early childhood education. Some people argue that children should begin their formal education at a very early age and spend most of their time on school studies, while others believe that young children should have the opportunity to spend most of their time playing and exploring their surroundings.
Those who advocate for early formal education argue that it is important for children to get a head start on their education in order to be academically successful later in life. They believe that starting formal education at a young age allows children to develop strong academic skills and knowledge at an early age, which can lead to better performance in school and in their future careers.
On the other hand, those who believe that young children should spend most of their time playing argue that play is an essential part of a child's development. They believe that play allows children to develop important social skills, such as communication, collaboration, and problem-solving. Play also allows children to learn about their interests and passions, which can help guide their future academic and career choices.
In my opinion, both approaches have merit and it is important to strike a balance between structured learning and play. While it is important for children to develop strong academic skills, it is also important for them to have the opportunity to explore their interests and to develop their social and emotional skills.
One approach that combines both structured learning and play is the Montessori method, which focuses on allowing children to learn at their own pace and to explore their interests through hands-on activities and play. This approach has been shown to be effective in promoting academic success and social and emotional development in young children.
In conclusion, while both early formal education and play have their benefits, it is important to find a balance between the two in order to promote both academic success and social and emotional development in young children.",0.0,1.0,AI
100.txt,"If I were asked to send one thing representing my country to an international exhibition, I would choose the Statue of Liberty. The Statue of Liberty is a symbol of freedom and democracy, representing the values that my country was founded upon.
The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States, and it has become one of the most iconic symbols of our country. It stands tall in the New York harbor, welcoming immigrants and visitors alike to our shores. The statue represents the ideals of freedom, liberty, and equality that have long been associated with the United States.
One of the reasons I would choose the Statue of Liberty to represent my country is that it symbolizes our commitment to freedom and democracy. The statue was given to the United States by France as a symbol of the friendship and alliance between the two countries, and it stands as a reminder of the values that both nations hold dear.
Another reason I would choose the Statue of Liberty is that it embodies the spirit of America as a melting pot of different cultures and backgrounds. The statue was designed by French sculptor Fr�d�ric Auguste Bartholdi, but it was constructed in the United States by workers from many different ethnic backgrounds. This represents the diverse makeup of our country and the fact that people from all over the world have contributed to our nation's success.
In addition to its symbolic value, the Statue of Liberty is also an impressive work of art. The statue is made of copper, and it stands over 300 feet tall. It is a truly awe-inspiring sight, and it would be an excellent choice to represent the United States at an international exhibition.
In conclusion, if I were asked to send one thing representing my country to an international exhibition, I would choose the Statue of Liberty. It symbolizes our commitment to freedom and democracy, and it embodies the spirit of America as a melting pot of different cultures. Additionally, it is an impressive work of art that would make a great impression at an international exhibition.",0.0,1.0,AI
128.txt,"It is a common belief that older people have more life experience and therefore have more to teach younger people. However, I disagree with the statement that there is nothing that young people can teach older people.
Firstly, young people often have a fresh perspective on things that can be valuable to older people. With their limited life experience, they may approach problems and ideas with a different perspective that can lead to innovative solutions. For example, younger people may be more adept at using technology and may be able to teach older people how to use new devices or navigate new software.
Secondly, young people can also teach older people about current trends and popular culture. As younger people are often more immersed in contemporary society, they can provide insight into what is popular and relevant in the present moment. This can help older people stay current and understand the perspectives and experiences of younger generations.
Additionally, young people can also teach older people about the importance of maintaining an open mind and being open to new ideas. As we age, it can be easy to become set in our ways and resistant to change. However, young people can remind us of the value of flexibility and adaptability in our thinking.
In conclusion, while older people may have more life experience and may have much to teach younger people, there are also many things that young people can teach older people. From a fresh perspective and current knowledge of trends and technology to the importance of an open mind, there is much that young people can offer those who are older.",0.0,1.0,AI
129.txt,"There is no definitive answer to the question of whether reading fiction is more enjoyable than watching movies, as personal preferences vary greatly from person to person. Some people may find reading to be more enjoyable because it allows them to fully immerse themselves in the world of the story and use their imagination to visualize the characters and settings. Others may find watching movies to be more enjoyable because they can experience the story in a more visual and auditory way, without having to do as much mental work to fill in the details.
One reason that some people may prefer reading fiction to watching movies is that reading allows them to fully immerse themselves in the story. When reading a book, a person can take their time to really get to know the characters and understand their motivations and emotions. They can also take their time to fully absorb the details of the plot and the setting, and use their own imagination to visualize everything. This can be a very immersive and satisfying experience for some people.
In contrast, watching a movie often requires less mental effort, as the visuals and sound effects help to bring the story to life. However, this can also be a disadvantage for some people, as it may be harder to fully engage with the story and become invested in the characters. Some people may find that they are more easily distracted by the visual elements of a movie, and that they don't get as lost in the story as they do when reading a book.
Another reason that some people may prefer reading fiction to watching movies is that reading allows them to engage with the story at their own pace. When reading a book, a person can take breaks whenever they want and come back to the story at a later time without losing their place or missing any important details. In contrast, when watching a movie, a person has to commit to watching the entire thing in one sitting and may feel pressure to keep up with the pace of the story.
On the other hand, some people may prefer watching movies to reading fiction because they find it to be a more visually and emotionally engaging experience. Movies can be more cinematic and dramatic, and can often convey emotions in a more powerful way through the use of music, camera angles, and other visual elements. Additionally, some people may find that watching a movie is more convenient than reading a book, as it requires less time and effort to sit down and watch a movie than it does to read a book.
In conclusion, whether reading fiction or watching movies is more enjoyable is ultimately a matter of personal preference. Both have their own unique advantages and drawbacks, and it is up to the individual to decide which one they prefer. Some people may find that they enjoy the immersive and mentally engaging experience of reading, while others may prefer the more visual and convenient experience of watching movies.",0.0,1.0,AI
101.txt,"There are pros and cons to both options when it comes to deciding whether to have the university assign a student to share a dorm room with you or to choose your own roommate. Ultimately, the decision will depend on an individual's personal preferences and needs.
One advantage of having the university assign a student to share a dorm room with you is that it removes the stress and uncertainty of finding a compatible roommate. The university will typically consider factors such as academic interests, class schedules, and living habits when pairing students together, which can help ensure a smooth and harmonious living arrangement. In addition, having a roommate assigned by the university can be a great opportunity to meet new people and make new friends.
On the other hand, choosing your own roommate can allow for more control and flexibility in the living arrangement. You can select a friend or acquaintance that you already know and trust, which can help foster a more comfortable and familiar living environment. Additionally, choosing your own roommate allows you to have a say in the specific living arrangements, such as whether or not to have overnight guests or how to divide up household chores.
Ultimately, both options have their own benefits and drawbacks. It is important to carefully consider your own needs and preferences before deciding whether to have the university assign a student to share a dorm room with you or to choose your own roommate.",0.0,1.0,AI
115.txt,"Establishing a new university in a community can bring both advantages and disadvantages.
One advantage of a new university in the community is the potential for economic growth. Universities often bring in a large number of students, faculty, and staff, which can increase the demand for housing, restaurants, and other local businesses. This can lead to an influx of money into the community, as well as the creation of new jobs. Additionally, the presence of a university can attract research funding and other investment opportunities, further boosting the local economy.
Another advantage is the opportunity for increased access to education. A new university in the community can provide more options for higher education, making it easier for local students to stay in the area and pursue their studies. This can be especially beneficial for those who may not have the resources or desire to travel far from home for college.
However, there are also potential disadvantages to consider. One potential issue is the strain that a new university can put on the community's resources, such as roads, public transportation, and utilities. The increased population and demand for services can also lead to issues with overcrowding and a lack of available housing.
Additionally, the construction of a new university can lead to environmental concerns, such as the potential for habitat destruction and the emission of greenhouse gases. It is important for the community and the university to consider and address these issues in the planning and development process.
In conclusion, while a new university in the community can bring economic growth and increased access to education, it is important to carefully consider the potential disadvantages and take steps to address them.",0.0,1.0,AI
14.txt,"There are pros and cons to both eating at food stands or restaurants and preparing and eating food at home. Personally, I prefer to prepare and eat food at home for several reasons.
One reason I prefer to eat at home is the cost. While eating out can be a convenient option, it can also be more expensive than cooking at home. By cooking at home, I am able to control my budget and spend less on food overall. I can also choose to use cheaper ingredients or leftovers to stretch my food budget further.
Another reason I prefer eating at home is the control it gives me over my food choices. When eating out, I am limited to the menu options available at the restaurant or food stand. However, when I prepare my own food at home, I have the ability to choose exactly what I want to eat and can tailor my meals to my specific tastes and dietary restrictions.
Furthermore, eating at home allows me the opportunity to cook in a healthier manner. I can control the amount of oil, salt, and sugar used in my meals and can opt for healthier ingredients. I can also portion my meals properly, rather than being served large restaurant portions that may be too much for me to consume.
Finally, eating at home allows for a more relaxed and enjoyable dining experience. I can choose to eat in the comfort of my own home, surrounded by familiar surroundings and without the noise and crowds often found in restaurants. I can also take my time and savor my meals without feeling rushed.
Overall, while there are certainly advantages to eating at food stands or restaurants, I prefer to prepare and eat food at home due to the cost savings, control over my food choices, ability to eat healthier, and more relaxed dining experience.",0.0,1.0,AI
28.txt,"In my opinion, I agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. There are several reasons why I believe this to be true.
First and foremost, doing things that we do not enjoy can often lead to personal growth and development. While it may be tempting to only engage in activities that bring us pleasure and enjoyment, it is important to also challenge ourselves and try new things. For example, if someone has a fear of public speaking, they may not enjoy giving presentations or speeches. However, by pushing themselves to do it anyway, they may find that they are able to overcome their fear and become a more confident and effective speaker. This type of personal growth can lead to a sense of accomplishment and pride, which can be rewarding in itself.
Another reason why people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy is that it can help us to better understand and appreciate the things that we do enjoy. By exposing ourselves to a variety of experiences, we can gain a greater understanding of what we truly enjoy and what we value. For example, if someone has always enjoyed playing sports but has never tried playing a musical instrument, they may find that they enjoy playing music more than they expected. By trying new things, we can discover new passions and interests that we may have otherwise missed out on.
Additionally, doing things that we do not enjoy can also help us to build resilience and determination. It is easy to give up on something when it becomes challenging or unpleasant, but by pushing through and persevering, we can develop a stronger sense of determination and resilience. This can be especially valuable in our careers, as it can help us to overcome challenges and setbacks and to achieve our goals.
Finally, it is important to remember that sometimes, doing things that we do not enjoy is simply a necessary part of life. For example, we may need to do household chores or attend to tasks at work that we do not particularly enjoy, but they are important for the smooth functioning of our daily lives. By accepting that we will need to do things that we do not enjoy from time to time, we can learn to be more resilient and adaptable.
In conclusion, I believe that people should sometimes do things that they do not enjoy doing. While it may be tempting to only engage in activities that bring us pleasure, doing things that challenge us and expose us to new experiences can lead to personal growth, a greater appreciation for the things we enjoy, and the development of resilience and determination.",0.0,1.0,AI
16.txt,"A good neighbor is someone who is considerate, respectful, and helpful. They are willing to lend a helping hand when needed and are understanding when there are disruptions or noise in the neighborhood.
One quality of a good neighbor is considerateness. This means they are mindful of the impact their actions have on those around them. For example, a good neighbor might be considerate by not blasting loud music late at night or by not letting their pets roam freely in other people's yards.
Another important quality of a good neighbor is respect. A good neighbor respects the boundaries and privacy of those around them and does not invade their space without permission. They also respect the rules and regulations of the community and do not cause problems for others.
Helpfulness is another important quality of a good neighbor. A good neighbor is willing to lend a helping hand when needed, whether it be by offering a ride to the store, helping with yard work, or just being there to listen and offer support.

103.txt,"There are pros and cons to both doing work by hand and using machines. Personally, I prefer using machines because they can be more efficient and precise.
One reason I prefer using machines is that they can complete tasks much faster than if they were done by hand. For example, a machine can sew a garment much faster than a person could with a needle and thread. This is especially useful in industries where time is a critical factor, such as in mass production or when meeting tight deadlines.
Another reason I prefer using machines is that they can be more precise than human hands. For example, a machine can cut materials with perfect accuracy, whereas a person using hand tools may have a harder time achieving the same level of precision. This is especially important in fields such as manufacturing, where precision is crucial in creating high-quality products.
However, there are also valid arguments for doing work by hand. One reason is that it can be more satisfying and rewarding to create something with your own hands. There is a certain level of pride that comes with knowing that you have created something entirely by yourself. Additionally, doing work by hand can be more tactile and immersive, allowing you to fully engage with the task at hand.
In conclusion, while there are benefits to both doing work by hand and using machines, I personally prefer using machines because they can be more efficient and precise. However, I do recognize that there are also valid arguments for doing work by hand, and it ultimately depends on the task and the individual's preferences.",0.0,1.0,AI
117.txt,"There are benefits to both planning and not planning activities for one's free time. Those who prefer to carefully plan their leisure activities may do so for a variety of reasons. One benefit of planning is that it allows for more efficient use of time. By scheduling activities in advance, individuals can ensure that they are making the most of their free time and not wasting it on unproductive or unfulfilling pursuits. This can be especially helpful for those with busy schedules or specific goals in mind, as it allows them to fit in the activities that matter most to them.
Another benefit of planning is that it can help to reduce stress and uncertainty. By having a clear plan in place, individuals can feel more in control of their time and less anxious about what to do with it. This can be especially useful for those who are prone to feeling overwhelmed or indecisive. Planning can also help individuals to feel more organized and on top of their commitments, which can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
On the other hand, some people prefer not to make any plans for their free time and instead choose to be spontaneous. One benefit of this approach is that it can allow for greater flexibility and adaptability. By not having any fixed plans, individuals are free to take advantage of opportunities that arise unexpectedly and can be more open to new and spontaneous experiences. This can lead to a sense of excitement and adventure, as well as the opportunity to try new things and be open to new possibilities.
Another benefit of not making plans is that it can allow for greater relaxation and downtime. Without the pressure of having to adhere to a strict schedule, individuals can take things as they come and simply go with the flow. This can be especially helpful for those who lead busy and stressful lives and need to find ways to relax and recharge.
In my personal experience, I prefer to have a balance between planning and not planning for my leisure time. While I find that planning can be helpful for achieving specific goals or maximizing my time, I also appreciate the freedom and flexibility of being spontaneous. I think that both approaches can be valuable depending on the situation, and that finding the right balance is key to having a fulfilling and enjoyable leisure time.",0.0,1.0,AI
116.txt,"The family and friends both play important roles in the development of young adults and can influence their decisions and behaviors in different ways. While some may argue that the family is the most important influence, others may believe that friends have a greater impact. In my opinion, both the family and friends can be equally important influences on young adults, depending on the individual and the specific circumstances.
On one hand, the family can have a strong influence on young adults due to the close relationship and frequent interactions with family members. Families often provide a sense of belonging, support, and guidance to their children as they navigate the challenges of adolescence and young adulthood. For example, a young adult who has a close relationship with their parents may be more likely to seek their advice and guidance when making important decisions, such as choosing a career or deciding whether to attend college.
Additionally, the values, beliefs, and behaviors of the family can also have a lasting impact on young adults. For instance, a young adult who grows up in a household where education is valued may be more likely to prioritize their academic pursuits and pursue higher education. On the other hand, a young adult who grows up in a household where substance abuse is prevalent may be more likely to engage in risky behaviors and suffer negative consequences as a result.
On the other hand, friends can also be a significant influence on young adults. Friends often serve as a source of social support, companionship, and identity formation during this developmental stage. For example, a young adult who has a group of supportive friends may feel more confident and secure in their identity, while a young adult who lacks supportive friends may feel isolated and vulnerable.
Furthermore, friends can also expose young adults to new experiences, ideas, and perspectives that may shape their beliefs and behaviors. For instance, a young adult who has friends with diverse backgrounds and interests may be more open-minded and open to new experiences, while a young adult who only associates with a narrow group of friends may be less exposed to diversity and new ideas.
In conclusion, both the family and friends can be important influences on young adults, and the impact of each can vary depending on the individual and the specific circumstances. While the family may provide a sense of belonging, support, and guidance, friends can serve as a source of social support, companionship, and exposure to new ideas and experiences.

Both of these areas can have significant impacts on the well-being and prosperity of a society, and striking a balance between the two is essential for creating a healthy and sustainable society.
On one hand, investing in computer technology can bring numerous benefits to a society. It can improve efficiency and productivity in various sectors, such as healthcare, education, and business. For example, the use of electronic medical records and telemedicine can help reduce administrative burden and improve patient care. In education, technology can enhance teaching and learning by providing access to a wealth of information and resources. In business, the use of computers can streamline operations and improve decision-making.
Furthermore, investing in computer technology can also contribute to economic growth and job creation. The development and use of technology can lead to the creation of new industries and employment opportunities, particularly in fields such as software development and data analysis.
On the other hand, it is also important for governments to invest in basic needs, such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. These investments can have a direct and immediate impact on the well-being and quality of life of citizens. For example, investing in healthcare can improve access to medical care and reduce mortality rates. Investing in education can improve literacy and skills, leading to better job prospects and higher incomes. And investing in infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, and public transportation, can improve connectivity and facilitate economic activity.
In conclusion, both computer technology and basic needs are important areas for government investment.

Artists contribute to society in a number of ways. They create works of art that are enjoyed by people all around the world, and their creations often have a deep emotional impact on those who experience them. Whether it is a painting, a sculpture, a film, or a piece of music, art has the power to move people in ways that few other things can.

For some people, spending time alone can be incredibly rewarding and restorative. Being alone allows for introspection, solitude, and the opportunity to recharge one's batteries. Many people find that they are able to think more clearly, be more productive, and engage in activities they enjoy when they are alone. For example, someone who enjoys reading may prefer to spend a quiet evening at home with a book rather than socializing with friends.
On the other hand, spending time with friends can be incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling. Having a strong social support system is important for mental and emotional well-being, and spending time with friends can provide a sense of belonging and connection.

Some people prefer to spend time with one or two close friends, while others choose to spend time with a large number of friends. Both approaches have their own advantages, and the choice ultimately depends on an individual's personality and preferences.
One advantage of spending time with one or two close friends is the depth of the relationships. When you have a small number of friends, you are able to devote more time and attention to each of them, and as a result, the relationships tend to be more intimate and meaningful. You may feel more comfortable sharing personal details and vulnerabilities with a close friend, and you may also feel more supported during difficult times. In addition, close friendships tend to be more reliable and stable, as you are able to rely on each other and work through any issues that may arise.
On the other hand, spending time with a large number of friends has its own advantages. For one, having a diverse group of friends can expose you to different perspectives and experiences, which can broaden your horizons and help you learn new things. In addition, having a large social circle can provide a sense of belonging and community, and it can be fun to have a variety of people to hang out with. With a large group of friends, you may also have more flexibility in terms of social plans, as you have a larger pool of people to choose from.
As for my own preference, I tend to lean towards spending time with one or two close friends. While I do have a number of acquaintances, I value the depth and intimacy of close friendships more. I find that I am able to form closer bonds with people when I am able to spend more quality time with them and get to know them on a deeper level.

107.txt,"There are both advantages and disadvantages to living in university housing versus living in an apartment in the community. One advantage of living in university housing is that it can be convenient and cost-effective. University housing is typically located on or near campus, making it easy for students to access their classes and other campus resources. Additionally, university housing often includes meal plans and other amenities, which can save students money on food and other expenses.
Another advantage of living in university housing is the opportunity to build community. Many university dormitories offer shared living spaces and social activities, which can help students form lasting friendships and support networks. This can be especially beneficial for students who are new to the area or who may be feeling homesick.
On the other hand, there are also advantages to living in an apartment in the community. One advantage is the opportunity for greater independence. Living in an apartment allows students to have their own private space and to make their own decisions about how to decorate and furnish their living quarters. Additionally, living in an apartment may offer more privacy and quiet than living in a dormitory, which can be a major benefit for students who need to study or focus on their work.
Another advantage of living in an apartment in the community is the opportunity to experience life outside of the university. Living in an apartment allows students to be a part of the larger community and to have access to a wider range of amenities and activities. This can be especially beneficial for students who want to get more involved in the local community or who are looking for new experiences.
Personally, I would prefer to live in an apartment in the community. While I see the value in the convenience and community-building aspects of university housing, I believe that the independence and opportunities for growth that come with living in an apartment would be more beneficial for me in the long run. I also appreciate the opportunity to experience life outside of the university and to be a part of the larger community.

12.txt,"There is a longstanding debate about whether universities should allocate the same amount of funding to student sports activities as they do to university libraries. In this essay, I will argue that while both sports activities and libraries are important for the university community, universities should prioritize funding for libraries over sports activities.
First and foremost, libraries are an integral part of a university's academic mission. They provide a wealth of knowledge and resources that students, faculty, and staff can access to support their research, learning, and teaching. Libraries often have large collections of books, journals, and other materials that cover a wide range of subjects and disciplines. In addition to traditional print materials, many libraries also offer access to electronic resources such as databases and e-books. These resources are essential for students to complete their coursework and for faculty to conduct research.
In contrast, sports activities, while important for physical health and well-being, are not directly related to the university's academic mission. While sports teams may provide opportunities for students to engage in physical activity and build teamwork skills, they are not essential to the educational process in the same way that libraries are.
Furthermore, university sports programs often require a significant amount of funding to support facilities, equipment, and coaching staff. This can be especially costly for large, Division I programs that compete at the highest level. Allocating a large portion of the university's budget to sports activities could potentially divert funding away from other areas, such as libraries and academic programs, that are more closely tied to the university's educational mission.
Additionally, while sports activities may be popular and generate revenue through ticket sales and merchandise, they are not necessarily the most financially stable source of funding for the university. In contrast, libraries can generate revenue through grants and donations, and may also be able to secure funding from external sources such as foundations and government agencies.
In conclusion, while sports activities are important for the well-being and engagement of the university community, universities should prioritize funding for libraries over sports activities. Libraries play a vital role in supporting the academic mission of the university and provide essential resources for research, learning, and teaching. Allocating a significant portion of the university's budget to sports activities could potentially divert funding away from other areas that are more closely tied to the university's educational mission.",0.0,1.0,AI
139.txt,"In my opinion, the most important room in a house is the kitchen. This room is more important to me than any other room because it is where I prepare and enjoy my meals, and where I spend time with my family and friends.
One of the key reasons why the kitchen is the most important room in my house is that it is where I prepare and enjoy my meals. I am a big foodie, and I love to cook and experiment with new recipes. The kitchen is where I have all the necessary tools and appliances to cook my meals, such as a stove, oven, and refrigerator. It is also where I have my dining table, where I enjoy my meals with my family and friends. The kitchen is therefore a central part of my daily routine, and it is where I spend a significant amount of my time.
Another reason why the kitchen is the most important room in my house is that it is where I spend time with my family and friends. The kitchen is often considered the heart of the home, and it is where people tend to gather and socialize. In my house, the kitchen is where my family and I sit and talk, share stories and jokes, and catch up on each other's lives. It is also where we have our dinner parties and celebrations, where we invite our friends and family to join us and enjoy a meal together. The kitchen is therefore a place of warmth, hospitality, and social connection, and it is where I feel most at home.
Furthermore, the kitchen is also the most important room in my house because it is where I can express my creativity and individuality. I love to decorate my kitchen with colorful and unique items, such as hand-painted pottery, vintage tablecloths, and herbs grown in my own garden. These items reflect my personal style and interests, and they make my kitchen feel welcoming and inviting. The kitchen is therefore a place where I can express myself, and where I can create a space that is truly my own.

111.txt,"When people move to another country, they often face the decision of whether to adapt to the customs of their new home or to hold onto the traditions of their native culture. Both choices have their own unique benefits and challenges, and the decision ultimately comes down to personal preference.
On one hand, adapting to the customs of the new country can have several advantages. For example, it can facilitate integration and acceptance within the local community, making it easier for the person to build relationships and find support in their new environment. Additionally, adopting the customs of the new country can help the person better understand and appreciate the culture of their new home, leading to a more enriching and fulfilling experience.
On the other hand, retaining one's own customs can also be beneficial. It can provide a sense of continuity and connection to one's roots, which can be especially important during times of transition and adjustment. Additionally, maintaining one's own customs can allow the person to preserve their cultural identity and pass on their traditions to future generations.
Personally, I believe that the best approach is to find a balance between adapting to the customs of the new country and maintaining one's own traditions. While it is important to respect and appreciate the culture of one's new home, it is also essential to maintain a sense of connection to one's own cultural heritage. By finding this balance, people can fully embrace the benefits of both choices and create a rich and fulfilling experience in their new home.",0.0,1.0,AI
105.txt,"In my opinion, the most important characteristic a person can have to be successful in life is determination. Determination is the quality that allows an individual to stay focused and motivated, even in the face of challenges and setbacks. It is the driving force behind a person's ability to achieve their goals and achieve success.
One of the key reasons why determination is so important is that it allows a person to persevere through difficult times and setbacks. When faced with obstacles, a determined person will not give up easily, but will instead find ways to overcome those challenges and keep moving forward. This can be especially important in achieving long-term goals, as it is rare for anyone to achieve success without facing any challenges along the way.
Another reason why determination is so important is that it allows a person to stay focused on their goals, even when faced with distractions or tempting alternatives. A determined person will not be swayed by external factors or distractions, but will instead remain focused on their ultimate objectives. This focus and commitment can be essential in helping a person stay on track and achieve their goals.
I have personally experienced the power of determination in my own life. For example, when I was in college, I was determined to graduate with honors, even though it meant putting in extra hours of studying and taking on a heavier course load. Despite the challenges and setbacks I faced, I remained determined and ultimately achieved my goal.
In conclusion, determination is the most important characteristic a person can have to be successful in life. It allows an individual to persevere through challenges and setbacks, stay focused on their goals, and achieve success.",0.0,1.0,AI
104.txt,"Asking students to evaluate their teachers can be a useful tool for improving the quality of education in schools. On the one hand, there are several reasons why this practice could be beneficial.
First and foremost, student evaluations can provide valuable insight into the effectiveness of a teacher's instructional methods. Students spend a significant amount of time in the classroom and have a unique perspective on how well their teacher is able to engage and educate them. By gathering feedback from students, schools can identify areas where a teacher may need to improve or make changes to their teaching style.
Additionally, student evaluations can help teachers to reflect on their own practice and identify areas for personal and professional growth. Teachers who are open to feedback and willing to make changes based on the needs of their students are more likely to be successful in the classroom.
On the other hand, there are also valid concerns about the potential drawbacks of student evaluations. For example, there is the risk that students may not fully understand the complexities of teaching and therefore may not provide reliable feedback. Additionally, students may be influenced by personal biases or may not have a complete understanding of the subject matter being taught.
Despite these concerns, I believe that the benefits of student evaluations outweigh the potential drawbacks. As long as schools take the necessary precautions to ensure that the evaluations are conducted in a fair and unbiased manner, the insights gained from student feedback can be invaluable in improving the quality of education.
In conclusion, I believe that schools should ask students to evaluate their teachers. While there are potential drawbacks to this practice, the benefits of gathering student feedback far outweigh any potential drawbacks. By using student evaluations as a tool for teacher improvement, schools can work towards providing the best possible education for all students.",0.0,1.0,AI
110.txt,"There are pros and cons to both listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience when it comes to understanding life. On the one hand, listening to the advice of loved ones can be very beneficial because they are often people we trust and who have our best interests at heart. They may have gone through similar experiences and can offer valuable insights and guidance. Additionally, receiving advice from others can save us time and effort in figuring things out for ourselves, as they can provide us with practical solutions to problems or point us in the right direction.
On the other hand, learning through personal experience can also be incredibly valuable. By going through things firsthand, we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for what we are learning. We can also develop critical thinking skills and independence as we navigate situations and make our own decisions. Personal experience can also help us build resilience, as we learn to cope with and overcome challenges and failures.
In terms of preference, I believe that both listening to the advice of family and friends and learning through personal experience have their place. Ultimately, the best way of learning about life is likely to be a combination of both. By seeking out the advice and guidance of loved ones and also actively seeking out opportunities to learn and grow through our own experiences, we can develop a well-rounded understanding of life.
For example, when faced with a difficult decision, it can be helpful to seek the advice of trusted friends or family members. However, ultimately, it is important to also consider our own values and goals and make a decision based on what feels right for us. This may involve taking a calculated risk and learning from the outcome, whether it is positive or negative.

11.txt,"There is no doubt that hard work is a crucial factor in achieving success. It requires determination, discipline, and a strong work ethic to put in the time and effort necessary to succeed in any endeavor. However, it is also important to recognize that luck can play a role in a person's success.
While hard work is certainly necessary for success, it is not always sufficient on its own. There are many external factors that can influence a person's chances of success, and luck is one of them. For example, a person may work hard to start a business, but if they happen to be in the right place at the right time, they may benefit from a sudden influx of customers or a favorable market trend. Alternatively, if they happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, they may struggle to find customers or be hit by an economic downturn.
Additionally, there are many examples of successful people who have benefited from circumstances outside of their control. For instance, a person may be born into a wealthy and influential family, which can provide them with opportunities and connections that would not have been available to them otherwise. Similarly, a person may have the luck to be born with a particular talent or natural ability that sets them up for success in a particular field.

76.txt,"There are both benefits and drawbacks to traveling in a group led by a tour guide. On one hand, having a tour guide can be very helpful in terms of organization and logistical support. A tour guide will typically handle all the arrangements for accommodation, transportation, and activities, which can be a great relief for travelers who may not have the time or knowledge to do so themselves. Tour guides are also knowledgeable about the local area and can provide valuable insights and information about the places being visited.
On the other hand, traveling in a group can also have some drawbacks. For one, group travel can be inflexible and may not allow for the same level of freedom and autonomy as independent travel. Group members may be required to stick to a set schedule and may not have the opportunity to explore on their own or deviate from the planned itinerary. Additionally, group dynamics can be challenging, as different people may have different expectations and preferences for how to spend their time.
Ultimately, whether the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide depends on the individual traveler and their specific needs and preferences. Some people may prefer the structure and support of a tour guide, while others may prefer the freedom and flexibility of independent travel. Ultimately, it is important to carefully consider one's own travel style and what will work best for them before deciding on the best way to travel.

62.txt,"Games are a form of play that have been enjoyed by people of all ages for centuries. While they are often associated with children, games can also be an important source of entertainment and relaxation for adults. In this essay, I will argue that games are just as important for adults as they are for children and provide specific reasons and examples to support my position.
First, games can provide adults with an opportunity to relax and unwind after a long day. Work and other responsibilities can be stressful, and taking a break to play a game can be a great way to de-stress and clear the mind. For example, a game of chess or a puzzle can provide a mental challenge that allows the player to focus on something other than their daily concerns. This can help to reduce anxiety and improve overall well-being.
Second, games can also be a great way for adults to socialize and connect with others. Many games are designed to be played with friends or family, and participating in these activities can provide a sense of connection and community. For example, a weekly game night with friends can be a fun and enjoyable way to spend time together and strengthen relationships.
Third, games can also have educational value for adults. Many games require players to think critically and problem-solve, which can help to improve cognitive skills such as critical thinking and decision-making. For example, a game of Scrabble can help adults improve their vocabulary and language skills, while a strategy game like Settlers of Catan can teach players about resource management and planning.
In conclusion, games are as important for adults as they are for children. They provide an opportunity to relax and de-stress, connect with others, and even improve cognitive skills. Whether played casually with friends or more competitively in organized tournaments, games can be an enjoyable and valuable part of adult life.",0.0,1.0,AI
89.txt,"In the last 100 years, one of the most beneficial discoveries for people in my country has been the development of the internet.
The internet has revolutionized the way we communicate, access information, and conduct business. It has brought the world closer together and made it easier for people to connect with each other, regardless of their location.
One of the most significant impacts of the internet has been on education. Students can now access a vast array of information and resources online, enabling them to learn at their own pace and in their own way. For example, online courses and MOOCs (massive open online courses) have made it possible for people to access high-quality education from top universities around the world, regardless of their financial means or physical location.
The internet has also had a major impact on the way we work. Many jobs can now be done remotely, enabling people to work from anywhere with an internet connection. This has increased flexibility and allowed people to balance their work and personal lives more effectively. It has also made it easier for people to start their own businesses, as they can reach a global market with just a few clicks.
In addition, the internet has made it easier for people to access healthcare services. Many hospitals and clinics now offer telemedicine services, which allow patients to consult with their doctors remotely. This can be especially beneficial for people living in rural or remote areas, where access to healthcare facilities may be limited.
Overall, the internet has had a profound impact on society, and its benefits are far-reaching.

The Renaissance was a time of great cultural and intellectual growth, marked by the rediscovery of classical knowledge and the flourishing of the arts, science, and philosophy.
One of the main reasons I would choose to go back to this time and place is because of the abundance of creative and innovative minds that flourished during this period. Some of the most famous artists, writers, and thinkers of all time, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Galileo, lived and worked during the Renaissance. I would love the opportunity to witness firsthand the amazing works of art and scientific discoveries that were made during this time, and to learn from and be inspired by the brilliant minds of the Renaissance.

63.txt,"It is a common belief that parents or other adult relatives should make important decisions for their older teenage children, especially those between the ages of 15 to 18. However, I disagree with this statement.
First and foremost, it is important to recognize that teenage children at this age are transitioning from childhood to adulthood. They are beginning to gain more independence and responsibilities, and should be allowed to make their own decisions as they navigate this new phase of life. While it is important for parents and adult relatives to provide guidance and support, it is ultimately the teenager's life and they should be given the opportunity to make their own choices.
Furthermore, allowing teenagers to make their own decisions can help them develop critical thinking skills and responsibility. By being able to make decisions on their own, teenagers can learn to weigh the pros and cons of different options and understand the consequences of their actions. This can also help them develop independence and become more self-sufficient.
Additionally, it is important to consider the fact that teenagers at this age are old enough to understand the gravity of important decisions and the impact they may have on their future. For example, decisions related to education or career paths are significant and can have long-lasting consequences. It is important to allow teenagers to have a say in these types of decisions, as they are the ones who will be most affected by them.
In conclusion, while it is natural for parents and adult relatives to want to protect and guide their teenage children, it is important to recognize that teenagers at this age are transitioning to adulthood and should be given the opportunity to make their own important decisions.

77.txt,"There are valid arguments for both approaches to university education, and the question of whether it is better for students to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject is ultimately a matter of personal preference and individual circumstances.
On one hand, some universities that require students to take a wide range of classes may argue that this approach exposes students to a variety of disciplines and helps them to develop a well-rounded education. This can be particularly beneficial for students who are unsure of what career they want to pursue after graduation, as it allows them to explore different fields and discover their passions and interests. Additionally, a broad education may provide students with a strong foundation in a variety of subjects, which can be valuable in today's rapidly changing job market.
On the other hand, universities that require students to specialize in one subject may argue that this approach allows students to become experts in their chosen field and better prepares them for career success. Specialization can also allow students to delve deeply into a subject, developing a level of mastery and understanding that may not be possible with a more general education. This can be particularly important for students who have a clear career goal in mind and want to position themselves as experts in their field.
Ultimately, the decision of whether to take classes in many subjects or to specialize in one subject depends on the individual student and their goals and interests.

One advantage of working for a large company is the potential for more stability and security. Large companies often have a long history and a strong financial foundation, which can provide employees with a sense of security in their job. Additionally, large companies often offer a wider range of benefits and opportunities for professional development and advancement. For example, they may have more resources to invest in employee training and development programs, and may have a larger number of management positions available for advancement.
On the other hand, working for a small company can also have its benefits. Small companies often have a more intimate and collaborative work environment, which can be more enjoyable for some people. Additionally, small companies may offer more flexibility in terms of work schedules and the ability to have a greater impact on the direction of the company. For those who prefer a more hands-on approach to their work and enjoy being able to see the results of their efforts, a small company may be a better fit.

Personally, I tend to fall more into the latter category and prefer to live life at a slower pace.
One reason for this is that I find that rushing through life often leads to a feeling of stress and anxiousness. When we are constantly in a hurry, we may feel pressure to meet deadlines and achieve certain goals, which can be overwhelming. On the other hand, taking things at a slower pace allows us to be more present in each moment and to appreciate the small joys in life. It gives us the space to reflect on our experiences and to make more mindful choices.
Another reason I prefer a slower pace is that it allows for a greater sense of connection with others. When we are constantly rushing from one place to the next, we may not have the time or energy to fully engage with the people around us. Taking things at a slower pace allows us to have more meaningful conversations and to build deeper relationships with those we care about.
Of course, there are times when it is necessary to move quickly and get things done, and I do not believe that one should always avoid a sense of urgency.

They have made many tasks faster and more efficient, and have provided us with access to vast amounts of information at our fingertips. However, there is also a valid argument that computers have made life more complex and stressful.
One of the main ways that computers have made life easier is by automating tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming and labor-intensive. For example, with just a few clicks, we can now book a flight or make a hotel reservation online, rather than spending hours on the phone or in line at a travel agency. Computers have also made it easier for people to work from home, allowing them to save time and money on commuting and providing more flexibility in their schedules.
However, the convenience of computers also comes with a cost. Many people now feel pressure to constantly be connected to the internet and to respond to emails and messages immediately. This constant connectivity can lead to feelings of stress and overwhelm, as we try to juggle multiple tasks and responsibilities at once. Additionally, computers have made it easier for us to multitask, which can actually decrease our productivity and make us feel more stressed.
Another way that computers have made life more complex is by introducing new risks and vulnerabilities. With the increasing reliance on computers and the internet, we are now exposed to a wide range of online threats, such as hacking, phishing, and malware. These threats can not only compromise our personal information, but also disrupt our daily lives and cause stress.

I would also consider the location of the land and the needs of the surrounding community. With this information in mind, I would then decide on the most effective and sustainable way to use the land.
One option for using the land would be to turn it into a small farm or garden. This would allow me to grow my own fresh produce, potentially even selling some of the excess to the local community. I would aim to use organic and sustainable farming practices, such as composting and natural pest control methods, to minimize the impact on the environment. This use of the land would not only provide me with nutritious food, but it could also serve as a source of income and a way to give back to the community.
Another possibility for using the land would be to create a nature preserve or conservation area. This would involve protecting the land from development and preserving the natural habitats of plants and animals. I would work with local conservation organizations to identify and prioritize the most important ecological features of the land, and take steps to protect and enhance these features. This could involve creating walking trails and educational signage, as well as working to restore or protect endangered species or ecosystems. This use of the land would not only benefit the natural environment, but it could also provide a valuable resource for the community, offering a place to connect with nature and learn about the environment.
Ultimately, the way I would use the land would depend on a variety of factors, including the resources available, the needs of the community, and my own personal goals and values.

74.txt,"Grades, or marks, are a commonly used method of evaluating and measuring a student's progress and understanding of a subject. Some people argue that grades encourage students to learn, while others disagree. In my opinion, grades can be a useful tool for promoting learning, but they are not the only factor and can also have negative consequences.
One argument in favor of grades is that they provide motivation for students to work hard and improve their knowledge and skills. Receiving a good grade can be a tangible reward for a student's efforts and can serve as encouragement to continue striving for academic success. For example, a student who consistently earns high grades in a particular subject may be more likely to pursue that subject in the future or to work towards a related career.
However, grades can also create pressure and anxiety for students, particularly if they are overly focused on getting a certain score or outperforming their peers. This can lead to unhealthy competition and a lack of intrinsic motivation, as students may be more concerned with meeting external expectations rather than pursuing their own interests and curiosity.
In addition, grades do not always accurately reflect a student's understanding or knowledge of a subject. They may be influenced by factors such as the difficulty of the assignment, the student's test-taking abilities, or the teacher's grading standards. This can result in students being unfairly evaluated or discouraged from learning if they receive poor grades despite putting in effort.
Overall, while grades can serve as a useful tool for promoting learning, they should not be the sole focus of a student's educational experience. It is important for students to have a variety of learning experiences and opportunities to pursue their interests, rather than being solely focused on achieving high grades. Additionally, grades should be used in conjunction with other forms of assessment, such as projects, presentations, and discussions, to provide a more holistic understanding of a student's knowledge and abilities.",0.0,1.0,AI

While it is true that businesses exist to make a profit, this does not mean that they should engage in unethical or irresponsible behavior in order to achieve this goal.
First and foremost, businesses have a responsibility to uphold ethical standards and operate in a socially responsible manner. This includes respecting the rights and well-being of their employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate. If a business is willing to sacrifice these values in the pursuit of profit, it is likely to face negative consequences such as damage to its reputation, loss of customer trust, and potential legal consequences.
Additionally, prioritizing profit above all else can lead to short-term thinking and a lack of focus on long-term sustainability. For example, a company may prioritize maximizing profits in the present by cutting costs and ignoring the impact of its actions on the environment. However, this approach is not sustainable in the long run, as ignoring environmental concerns can lead to negative consequences such as pollution and resource depletion.
On the other hand, businesses that take a more holistic approach to making a profit, considering the needs of all stakeholders and the long-term sustainability of their operations, are likely to be more successful in the long run. These companies often have strong reputations, loyal customers, and motivated employees, all of which contribute to their financial success.

64.txt,"Out of intelligence, a sense of humor, and reliability, I believe that reliability is the most important characteristic in a friend. While intelligence and a sense of humor can certainly enhance a friendship, I value reliability because it is the foundation upon which all other aspects of a friendship can be built.
Having a reliable friend means that I can count on them to be there for me when I need them. Whether I need a shoulder to cry on, someone to confide in, or just someone to hang out with, a reliable friend will be there for me. In contrast, a friend who is not reliable may not be there when I need them, which can leave me feeling isolated and unsupported.
One specific example of the importance of reliability in a friendship is when I was going through a difficult time in my life. I was struggling with depression and had a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. One of my friends, who was reliable, would check in on me every day and encourage me to get out of bed and get dressed. This small act of kindness made a huge difference in my life and helped me get through a tough time.
In contrast, I have had experiences with friends who were not reliable and it has caused problems in the friendship. For example, I had a friend who would make plans with me and then cancel last minute, or who would promise to help me with something and then not follow through. These experiences left me feeling frustrated and let down, and ultimately caused a strain in the friendship.
In conclusion, while intelligence and a sense of humor are certainly valuable qualities in a friend, I believe that reliability is the most important characteristic. Having a reliable friend means that I can count on them to be there for me when I need them, and this is something that is invaluable to me.",0.0,1.0,AI
70.txt,"There is a debate about whether or not daily homework is necessary for students. On one hand, some argue that daily homework is essential for students to reinforce concepts learned in class and to develop good study habits. On the other hand, others argue that daily homework can be overwhelming and burdensome for students, leading to increased stress and decreased motivation.
One argument in favor of daily homework is that it helps students to reinforce concepts learned in class. When students complete homework assignments, they are given the opportunity to practice and apply what they have learned in a more controlled setting. This can help to solidify their understanding of the material and improve their retention of the information. Additionally, daily homework can help students to develop good study habits, such as setting aside dedicated time for work and prioritizing tasks. These habits can be beneficial for students as they progress through their education and beyond.
However, it is also important to consider the potential negative effects of daily homework. For some students, the burden of daily homework can be overwhelming, leading to increased stress and decreased motivation. This is especially true for students who are struggling in class or who have other responsibilities, such as part-time jobs or caring for family members. In these cases, the added pressure of daily homework can be detrimental to a student's mental health and overall well-being.
Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to assign daily homework should be based on the individual needs and abilities of each student. Some students may benefit from daily homework and thrive with the added structure and reinforcement, while others may struggle and need more flexibility. It is important for teachers to consider the unique needs of their students and to find a balance that works best for them. Overall, while daily homework can be beneficial in certain situations, it is important to consider its potential drawbacks and to approach it with caution.",0.0,1.0,AI
58.txt,"As a society, we are faced with many important issues that require funding and support in order to be addressed effectively. When it comes to deciding how to allocate resources, it can be difficult to choose between competing priorities. In this case, the decision is between supporting the arts or protecting the environment. Ultimately, I believe that the company should choose to protect the environment. Here are a few specific reasons why:
First and foremost, the environment is essential to our very survival. The air we breathe, the water we drink, and the resources we rely on all come from the natural world. If we do not take care of the environment, we risk damaging these vital systems and putting our own well-being at risk. In contrast, while the arts can bring joy and cultural enrichment, they are not necessary for our basic survival.
Secondly, protecting the environment has long-term benefits. Many environmental problems, such as climate change and pollution, take years or even decades to address. Investing in environmental protection now can help prevent or mitigate future problems, ensuring a better future for ourselves and future generations. In contrast, supporting the arts is more of a short-term solution, providing enjoyment in the present but not necessarily having a lasting impact.
Finally, protecting the environment has the potential to benefit a wide range of people and industries. For example, investing in clean energy or conservation efforts can create jobs and stimulate economic growth. It can also help preserve natural resources, which can be used sustainably to benefit local communities. In contrast, supporting the arts may only directly benefit a small group of people, such as artists or those who regularly attend cultural events.
In conclusion, while both supporting the arts and protecting the environment are important and worthy causes, I believe that the company should prioritize protecting the environment. The environment is essential to our survival and has long-term benefits that can improve the lives of a wide range of people. By investing in environmental protection, the company can help ensure a better future for all of us.",0.0,1.0,AI
59.txt,"There are many different types of movies out there, and each person has their own personal preference when it comes to the type of movie they enjoy watching. Personally, I prefer movies that are designed to amuse and entertain.
One reason I prefer these types of movies is because they provide a much-needed break from the stress and responsibilities of everyday life. When I watch a funny movie, I can forget about my worries and just relax and have a good time. I also find that these types of movies often have positive messages and themes, which can be uplifting and inspire hope.
Another reason I prefer movies that are designed to amuse and entertain is because they can bring people together. Whether I am watching a movie with friends or family, these types of movies provide a shared experience that can be enjoyable for everyone. They can also be a great way to bond and create lasting memories.
Of course, there is certainly value in movies that are designed to make the audience think as well. These types of movies can challenge our perspectives and beliefs, and can inspire us to consider new ideas. However, I find that I often need to be in a certain mindset to truly appreciate these types of movies, and they can sometimes be more of a mental effort to watch.
Overall, while both types of movies can have their own unique value and appeal, I prefer movies that are designed to amuse and entertain. They provide a much-needed escape from the stresses of daily life, and can bring people together in a way that is both enjoyable and meaningful.",0.0,1.0,AI

65.txt,"I agree with the statement that most experiences in our lives that seemed difficult at the time become valuable lessons for the future. There are several reasons why this is the case.
First, difficult experiences often involve challenges that push us out of our comfort zone and help us to grow as individuals. For example, if we are faced with a difficult decision, we may have to confront our own biases and limitations in order to make the best choice. This process of self-reflection and self-improvement can be difficult, but it is also invaluable in helping us to become more self-aware and capable of handling future challenges.
Second, difficult experiences can also teach us valuable lessons about resilience and perseverance. When we face challenges, we are often forced to find ways to adapt and overcome them, which can help to build our strength and determination. For example, if we face a difficult setback in our careers, we may have to find ways to bounce back and keep moving forward. This process of overcoming adversity can be tough, but it can also help us to develop the skills and mindset we need to thrive in the face of future challenges.
Finally, difficult experiences can also help us to appreciate the good things in our lives. When we face difficult times, it can be easy to focus on the negatives and lose sight of the many blessings we have. However, by working through difficult experiences and coming out on the other side, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the things that truly matter to us, such as our relationships, our health, and our sense of purpose.

73.txt,"Choosing between a high-paying job with long hours and a lower-paying job with shorter hours is a difficult decision that requires careful consideration of a variety of factors. Ultimately, I would choose the lower-paying job with shorter hours because it would give me more time with family and friends.
One of the main reasons I would choose a lower-paying job with shorter hours is because I value my relationships with my loved ones. While a high-paying job may provide financial security and stability, it would also likely require a significant amount of time and energy, leaving little room for maintaining and nurturing relationships with family and friends. On the other hand, a lower-paying job with shorter hours would allow me to have more flexibility in my schedule, giving me the opportunity to spend quality time with my loved ones.
Another reason I would choose a lower-paying job with shorter hours is because I believe that personal fulfillment and happiness are important aspects of a successful and fulfilling career. While a high-paying job may bring financial success, it may not necessarily bring happiness or personal fulfillment if it requires sacrificing time with loved ones or pursuing interests outside of work. On the other hand, a lower-paying job with shorter hours would allow me to pursue my passions and interests outside of work, and would also allow me to have a better work-life balance, which could lead to greater overall satisfaction and happiness.
In conclusion, while a high-paying job may bring financial security and stability, I believe that the benefits of a lower-paying job with shorter hours, such as more time with family and friends and greater personal fulfillment, outweigh the potential financial sacrifices. Ultimately, the choice between a high-paying job with long hours and a lower-paying job with shorter hours depends on an individual's priorities and values.",0.0,1.0,AI
67.txt,"The question of whether a city should preserve its old, historic buildings or destroy them and replace them with modern buildings is a complex and nuanced one. There are valid arguments to be made on both sides, and ultimately the decision should be based on the specific circumstances and priorities of the city in question.
One argument in favor of preserving historic buildings is that they are an important part of a city's cultural and historical identity. These buildings often represent significant events, people, or architectural styles from the past, and they can provide a sense of continuity and connection to the city's past. For example, a city's old town square or main street may be lined with historic buildings that have been around for hundreds of years, and these buildings may be an important part of the city's local culture and traditions. In addition, many people find these old buildings to be visually appealing and charming, and they may be an important part of the city's tourism industry.
However, there are also valid reasons why a city might choose to destroy its historic buildings and replace them with modern ones. For example, these old buildings may be in disrepair or unsafe to occupy, and it may be more cost-effective or practical to demolish them and start fresh. Additionally, modern buildings may be more energy efficient and environmentally sustainable, which can be important considerations for a city looking to reduce its carbon footprint and protect the environment. Finally, modern buildings may be able to accommodate more people or businesses, which can help to boost the city's economy and provide more opportunities for its citizens.
Ultimately, the decision of whether to preserve or destroy a city's historic buildings should be based on a careful consideration of all of these factors. It may be that the best course of action is to preserve some buildings while replacing others, or to find ways to modernize and renovate existing historic buildings rather than tearing them down. Ultimately, the most important thing is to find a balance that respects the city's past while also addressing the needs and priorities of the present and future.",0.0,1.0,AI
9.txt,"Television has been a popular form of entertainment for many decades, and it has undoubtedly had an impact on communication among friends and family. However, whether that impact has been positive or negative is a matter of debate. Some people argue that television has destroyed communication among friends and family, while others believe that it has actually enhanced it in certain ways.
On the one hand, it is true that television can be a major distraction, particularly when it is used excessively. If people spend all of their free time watching television, they may have less time to engage in meaningful conversations and activities with their friends and family. Additionally, television can be a solitary activity, which can lead to feelings of isolation and disconnection.
Furthermore, some argue that television promotes passive consumption rather than active communication. Rather than having conversations and interacting with each other, people may simply sit in front of the television and absorb whatever content is being presented to them. This can lead to a lack of critical thinking and the inability to engage in meaningful discussions with others.
However, it is also important to consider the ways in which television can enhance communication among friends and family. For example, many people use television as a way to bond and connect with each other. For example, families may watch a favorite TV show together and then have conversations about it afterwards. Additionally, television can serve as a way to initiate discussions about important issues or to spark conversations about shared interests.
In conclusion, while it is true that television can be a distraction and can potentially promote passive consumption, it is not accurate to say that it has completely destroyed communication among friends and family. While it is important to be mindful of the time and energy we devote to television, it can also be a useful tool for connecting with others and fostering meaningful conversations.",0.0,1.0,AI
98.txt,"There are many different ways that people try to escape the stress and difficulties of modern life. Some people find solace in reading, immersing themselves in a good book and forgetting about the outside world for a while. Others turn to exercise, using physical activity as a way to clear their minds and relieve tension. Still others find that working in their gardens or spending time outdoors helps them to relax and de-stress.
Personally, I believe that the best ways of reducing stress depend on the individual and what works for them. Some people may find that participating in a physical activity, such as running or playing a sport, helps them to feel more relaxed and energized. Others may prefer more low-key activities, such as yoga or meditation, which can help to calm the mind and promote relaxation.
One thing that I think is important for reducing stress is finding activities that you enjoy and that bring you a sense of accomplishment or satisfaction. For example, if you love to cook, spending time in the kitchen preparing a meal may be a great way to relax and de-stress. Similarly, if you enjoy working with your hands, you might find that activities such as woodworking or painting can be therapeutic.
Another effective way to reduce stress is to make time for self-care and prioritize your own well-being. This might involve setting aside time to relax and recharge, getting enough sleep, or engaging in activities that nourish your body and mind, such as taking a warm bath or going for a massage.
Ultimately, the best way to reduce stress is to find activities and practices that work for you and that help you to feel more calm and centered.

99.txt,"There is no denying that teachers play a crucial role in shaping the future of their students and society as a whole. They are responsible for imparting knowledge, skills, and values to the next generation, and their work has a lasting impact on the lives of their students. With this in mind, it is natural to consider the question of how teachers should be paid and whether or not their salaries should be tied to the performance of their students.
There are arguments on both sides of this issue, and it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion. However, in my opinion, I do not agree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn. Here are some specific reasons why:
1. Teachers cannot control all factors that affect student learning: A teacher's job is to educate and guide students, but there are many other factors that can impact a student's ability to learn. These include the student's home environment, their health and wellbeing, and their personal motivation and engagement with the subject matter. A teacher cannot be held solely responsible for a student's learning if there are other factors at play.
2. Paying teachers based on student performance could lead to negative consequences: If teachers are paid based on student performance, there is a risk that they may feel pressure to focus solely on teaching to the test or grades rather than on providing a well-rounded education. This could result in a narrow, superficial approach to teaching that ignores the broader goals of education, such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Additionally, if teacher pay is tied to student performance, it could create an unhealthy competition among teachers and lead to a focus on individual rewards rather than a collaborative approach to education.
3. Other factors should be considered when determining teacher pay: There are many factors that should be taken into account when determining teacher pay, such as their level of education, years of experience, and the demand for their subject area. Additionally, teachers often go above and beyond their job duties, taking on extra responsibilities and working long hours outside of the classroom to ensure the success of their students. These extra efforts should also be considered when determining teacher pay.
In conclusion, while it is important to recognize the crucial role that teachers play in the education of their students, I do not believe that their pay should be tied solely to the performance of their students. There are many other factors that should be considered when determining teacher pay, and tying it to student performance could lead to negative consequences for both teachers and students.",0.0,1.0,AI
8.txt,"Movies and television have a significant influence on people's behavior. This is because these media forms provide people with examples of how to act and interact with others, as well as offering opportunities to vicariously experience different lifestyles and situations.
One way that movies and television influence behavior is through the portrayal of social norms and values. Many movies and television shows depict certain behaviors as acceptable or unacceptable, which can shape people's understanding of what is considered normal or appropriate in society. For example, a movie that portrays bullying as something that is acceptable or even cool may lead some viewers to believe that this type of behavior is okay in real life, while a movie that portrays bullying as wrong may discourage people from engaging in this type of behavior.
Another way that movies and television influence behavior is through the depiction of role models and characters that people aspire to emulate. Many people look to characters in movies and television as sources of inspiration and guidance, and may attempt to adopt certain behaviors or lifestyles as a result. For example, if a television show features a character who is successful and confident, some viewers may try to adopt similar traits in an effort to be more like the character.
Movies and television can also influence behavior through the portrayal of consequences for certain actions. By showing the consequences of certain behaviors, movies and television can serve as cautionary tales that discourage people from engaging in certain types of behavior. For example, a movie that shows the consequences of drug use may discourage some viewers from trying drugs in real life.
In addition, movies and television can influence behavior by providing people with vicarious experiences that allow them to explore different situations and lifestyles. This can help people to gain a better understanding of different perspectives and ways of life, which can in turn shape their behavior and how they interact with others.
Overall, it is clear that movies and television have a significant influence on people's behavior.

If I had to choose, I would rather work for someone else. There are several reasons for this choice.
First, as an employee, I would have a sense of stability and security. When working for someone else, I would receive a regular salary and benefits, such as health insurance and retirement savings plans. This stability would give me peace of mind and allow me to focus on my work and personal life without worrying about financial insecurity.
Second, working for someone else would give me the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with experienced professionals. I would be able to draw on the knowledge and resources of my employer and work alongside colleagues who have different skills and expertise. This would allow me to grow and develop my own skills and knowledge, which would be beneficial for my career development.
Third, as an employee, I would have a defined role and responsibilities, which would give me a sense of purpose and direction in my work. I would know exactly what is expected of me and would have the support of my employer to help me succeed in my role.
Finally, working for someone else would allow me to have a better work-life balance. As a self-employed person or business owner, I might have to put in long hours and make sacrifices in my personal life in order to meet the demands of my business. Working for someone else would give me more control over my schedule and allow me to have a more predictable work routine.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that the automobile has greatly improved modern life in many ways. It has given people the freedom and convenience to travel long distances quickly and efficiently, allowing for greater mobility and access to opportunities. It has also made it easier for people to transport goods and products, facilitating trade and commerce.
In addition, the automobile industry has created jobs and contributed to economic growth, and the development of new technologies in the automotive sector has led to innovations in areas such as safety and fuel efficiency.
On the other hand, it is also true that the automobile has caused serious problems, particularly in terms of environmental and public health. The burning of fossil fuels by automobiles is a major contributor to air pollution and climate change, and the proliferation of cars on the roads has led to congestion and increased accidents.
Moreover, the reliance on automobiles has had negative impacts on communities, such as the loss of pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods and the segregation of communities by physical barriers such as highways.
In conclusion, while the automobile has certainly brought many benefits to modern life, it has also caused serious problems that must be addressed.

57.txt,"There are valid arguments for both sides of this statement. On one hand, making important decisions alone can allow a person to fully consider their own values and goals, and to make a choice that is authentic and true to themselves. This can be especially important in cases where the decision may not align with the expectations or beliefs of others.
On the other hand, seeking the advice and input of others can be beneficial in many situations. For one, other people may have valuable insights and perspectives that the individual may not have considered. They may also be able to provide a sense of balance and objectivity, helping the individual to avoid making rash or impulsive decisions.
In addition, seeking the input of others can help to build trust and strengthen relationships. By asking for the thoughts and opinions of friends, family, or colleagues, the individual is demonstrating that they value and respect the perspective of others. This can lead to a greater sense of unity and collaboration, which can be especially important in business or team settings.
Ultimately, whether or not a person should make an important decision alone depends on the specific circumstances and the individual's own personal style and preferences. Some people may feel more comfortable and confident making decisions independently, while others may prefer to seek the guidance and support of others. Ultimately, the most important thing is to be thoughtful and deliberate in the decision-making process, and to consider all relevant factors before making a choice.",0.0,1.0,AI
5.txt,"There is no doubt that both knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books are valuable and important sources of learning. However, it is important to recognize that each has its own unique strengths and limitations, and it is ultimately up to the individual to determine which is more important in a given context.
One of the main advantages of knowledge gained from experience is that it is often more practical and applicable to real-world situations. When we learn through experience, we are able to directly apply what we have learned to the tasks and challenges we face in our daily lives. This can be especially valuable when it comes to learning hands-on skills, such as cooking, carpentry, or programming.
In contrast, knowledge gained from books tends to be more theoretical and abstract. While books can certainly provide a wealth of information and insight, they are often removed from the immediate context in which we live and work. This can make it more difficult to apply the knowledge gained from books to our everyday lives, although it can also provide a broader and more comprehensive understanding of a subject.
Another difference between knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books is the way in which it is acquired. When we learn through experience, we typically do so through trial and error, making mistakes and correcting them as we go. This can be a slow and often frustrating process, but it allows us to develop a deep understanding of a subject and to learn from our mistakes. In contrast, knowledge gained from books is often more structured and linear, allowing us to absorb information at a faster pace.
In my opinion, both knowledge gained from experience and knowledge gained from books are important and have their own unique value. Ultimately, the most important source of knowledge will depend on the individual and their needs and goals. For example, someone who is looking to learn a specific skill or trade may find that knowledge gained from experience is more important, while someone who is looking to gain a broad understanding of a particular subject may find that knowledge gained from books is more valuable.
Ultimately, the key is to recognize the strengths and limitations of both sources of knowledge and to use them in a way that is most effective for the individual. Whether we are learning through experience or through books, it is important to be open to new ideas and to continue seeking out opportunities to learn and grow.",0.0,1.0,AI
43.txt,"There is no doubt that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are important for the functioning and development of society. However, I disagree with the idea that these needs should be prioritized over saving land for endangered animals. There are several reasons why preserving land for endangered species is important and should not be overlooked.
First and foremost, biodiversity is essential for the health and stability of ecosystems. When species become extinct, it can lead to a ripple effect that impacts the entire ecosystem and the species that rely on it. For example, if a certain type of plant becomes extinct, the animals that rely on that plant for food may also become endangered.
In addition, preserving land for endangered species can have economic benefits. Eco-tourism, for example, can provide a source of income for communities and can be a more sustainable economic development strategy compared to other industries.
Furthermore, preserving land for endangered species is a moral obligation. Humans have a responsibility to protect and care for the planet and its inhabitants, including all forms of life. Ignoring this responsibility not only impacts the well-being of animals, but it also reflects negatively on our own character and values as a society.
It is important to recognize that finding a balance between human needs and preserving land for endangered species is not an easy task. However, it is possible to find solutions that address both concerns. For example, land could be used for agriculture in a way that also allows for the preservation of natural habitats and the protection of endangered species.
In conclusion, while human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are important, they should not be prioritized over saving land for endangered animals. Protecting and preserving land for endangered species is essential for the health of ecosystems, can have economic benefits, and is a moral obligation.

94.txt,"There are certainly advantages to living in a place with consistent weather or climate all year round. For one, it can be easier to plan and prepare for daily life when you know exactly what to expect in terms of weather. For example, if you live in a place with hot, sunny weather all year round, you can plan your wardrobe and activities accordingly, without having to worry about suddenly encountering cold temperatures or inclement weather. Similarly, if you live in a place with consistent cold weather, you can invest in warm clothing and gear that you can use throughout the year.
However, personally, I would prefer to live in an area where the weather changes several times a year. One of the main reasons for this is that I find the variety of weather to be more interesting and enjoyable. While it can be nice to have consistent weather, it can also get monotonous over time. In contrast, living in an area with changing weather allows you to experience a range of seasons and weather patterns, each with their own unique characteristics.
For example, living in an area with four distinct seasons allows you to enjoy the beauty of spring flowers, the warmth of summer sun, the colorful foliage of fall, and the cozy feeling of winter snow. Each season brings its own activities and opportunities, whether it's going on hikes in the spring, swimming in the summer, apple picking in the fall, or building snowmen in the winter.
In addition, living in an area with changing weather can also provide some benefits in terms of your physical and mental health. Studies have shown that exposure to natural light can have a positive impact on your mood and well-being, and experiencing different types of weather can provide a change in scenery and atmosphere that can be refreshing and rejuvenating.

80.txt,"Both the ability to work with a group of people on a team and to work independently are important skills to have in the modern world. However, the importance of one skill over the other may depend on the specific task or situation at hand.
One reason why the ability to work with a team is important is that it allows for greater collaboration and the sharing of diverse perspectives and skills. Working on a team allows individuals to pool their knowledge and resources, which can lead to more efficient and effective problem-solving. For example, a team of engineers may be able to design a more innovative and functional product if they are able to collaborate and bounce ideas off of each other.
Additionally, the ability to work with a team can be especially important in a professional setting, where it is often necessary to work with others to complete projects and meet deadlines. Strong teamwork skills can help to foster a positive and productive work environment, which can lead to better outcomes for the organization.
On the other hand, there are also situations where it is more important to be able to work independently. For example, if an individual is working on a task that requires a high level of focus and concentration, they may prefer to work alone to minimize distractions. Additionally, some tasks may require a high degree of independence and self-motivation, such as when working on a solo project or when completing a task with little supervision.
In conclusion, both the ability to work with a team and to work independently are important skills to have. The relative importance of these skills may depend on the specific task or situation at hand, and it is often useful to be able to adapt and switch between these two modes of working as needed.",0.0,1.0,AI

95.txt,"Living with roommates can be a rewarding experience, but it can also be challenging at times. In order to have a positive living situation, it is important for a roommate to possess certain qualities. Some of the important qualities of a good roommate include being respectful, responsible, and considerate.
One of the most important qualities of a good roommate is respect. This means respecting the other person's space, belongings, and schedule. It is important for a roommate to understand that they are sharing a living space and to be mindful of the other person's needs and boundaries. For example, if a roommate has a study group coming over, it is important for them to let the other roommate know in advance so that they can plan accordingly.
Another important quality of a good roommate is responsibility. This means being reliable and taking care of shared responsibilities, such as cleaning and paying rent on time. It is important for a roommate to be dependable and to follow through on their commitments, as this helps to create a stable and orderly living environment.
Consideration is another important quality of a good roommate. This means being considerate of the other person's feelings and needs, and being willing to compromise when necessary. For example, if one roommate prefers a quiet living space and the other likes to have friends over frequently, it is important for them to find a balance that works for both of them. This may involve setting designated quiet hours or finding a compromise that allows both roommates to have the living space they need.
In conclusion, a good roommate is one who is respectful, responsible, and considerate. These qualities are important because they help create a positive living environment and ensure that both roommates feel comfortable and respected in their shared living space.

42.txt,"I agree with the statement ""Never, never give up."" This expression encourages persistence and determination in the face of challenges and setbacks. It suggests that no matter how difficult a task may seem, or how many obstacles one may encounter along the way, it is important to keep trying and to never give up on one's goals.
There are many examples of individuals who have exemplified this idea by continuing to persevere and work towards their goals, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. For instance, consider the story of Thomas Edison, who is famous for his persistence and determination in the face of failure. Edison is often quoted as saying, ""I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work."" This attitude of perseverance allowed Edison to eventually invent the light bulb, a revolutionary technology that has had a profound impact on the world.
Another example of the power of ""never, never give up"" is the story of Roger Bannister, who was the first person to run a mile in under four minutes. This feat was once thought to be impossible, but Bannister's determination and hard work allowed him to break through this barrier and achieve his goal.
In my own life, I have also seen the importance of perseverance and determination. For example, I remember struggling with a particular subject in school. It was difficult for me, and I was tempted to give up and move on to something else. However, I decided to keep working at it, even though it was challenging. I put in extra time and effort, seeking help and guidance when needed, and eventually I was able to master the subject. This experience taught me the value of never giving up, even when things get tough.
In conclusion, I agree with the statement ""Never, never give up."" This expression embodies the importance of perseverance and determination in achieving one's goals. It reminds us that even when faced with challenges and setbacks, it is important to keep trying and to never give up.",0.0,1.0,AI
56.txt,"It is a common saying that one should never judge a person by their external appearances. While it is true that people should not be judged solely based on their physical appearance, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can sometimes provide valuable information about a person. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of this argument and provide specific reasons and details to support my conclusion.
On the one hand, it is wrong to judge a person solely based on their external appearances. There are countless examples of people who are judged unfairly based on their physical appearance, whether it be due to their race, ethnicity, gender, or other physical attributes. This type of judgment is not only unfair, but it also ignores the fact that people are complex individuals with unique experiences and perspectives.
For example, a person who is judged based on their appearance may be unfairly assumed to be lazy or unintelligent simply because they do not present themselves in a certain way. This type of judgment ignores the fact that people have different personal styles and may not prioritize certain aspects of their appearance. Additionally, external appearances do not always accurately reflect a person's character or abilities. A person who appears confident and put-together may actually be struggling with self-esteem issues, while a person who appears shy and unassuming may have a wealth of knowledge and experience.
On the other hand, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can sometimes provide valuable information about a person. For example, if a person is dressed in a uniform or is wearing a name tag, it is reasonable to assume that they are affiliated with a particular organization or profession. Similarly, if a person is wearing clothing or accessories that convey a certain message, it is reasonable to assume that they are trying to communicate something about themselves.
In conclusion, while it is wrong to judge a person solely based on their external appearances, it is also important to recognize that external appearances can provide valuable information about a person. It is important to consider both the potential biases and limitations of judging people based on their appearance, as well as the potential insights that external appearances can provide.",0.0,1.0,AI
68.txt,"There is no doubt that both classmates and parents can have a significant influence on a child's success in school. However, the extent to which each group influences a child's academic performance can vary depending on various factors.
On one hand, classmates can play a crucial role in a child's academic success. For instance, if a child has classmates who are academically motivated and encourage their peers to do well in school, it can create a positive learning environment and inspire the child to work harder. Classmates can also provide valuable support and encouragement during difficult times and can serve as a source of inspiration for a child to achieve their academic goals.
On the other hand, parents often have a more profound influence on a child's academic success than their classmates. Parents are typically the primary caregivers and role models for their children, and they have a direct impact on the child's upbringing and development. Parents can influence their child's academic success by providing a stable and supportive home environment, setting high expectations for their child's education, and being involved in their child's school life.
Additionally, parents can also provide practical support to their child's academic endeavors, such as ensuring that their child has access to necessary resources, such as textbooks and study materials, and providing transportation to and from school.

In fact, I believe that learning about the past is essential for understanding and improving the present, and it can also provide valuable perspective and context for our current experiences and decisions.
One reason why learning about the past is valuable is that it can help us understand and address current problems and challenges. For example, studying the causes and consequences of past wars can inform our approach to conflict resolution and diplomacy today. Similarly, understanding the history of social movements and civil rights struggles can help us work towards a more just and equitable society in the present. By learning from the successes and mistakes of the past, we can make more informed and effective decisions in the present.
Another reason why learning about the past is valuable is that it can provide context and perspective for our current experiences and understanding of the world. For example, studying the history of different cultures and societies can give us a deeper appreciation and understanding of the diverse perspectives and experiences of people around the world today. Learning about the past can also help us understand the foundations and evolution of the systems and institutions that shape our present, such as governments, economies, and social norms.
In addition, learning about the past can be personally enriching and help us connect with our own identities and heritage. By learning about our own family and cultural history, we can gain a sense of belonging and connection to those who came before us, and it can also help us understand and appreciate the unique experiences and challenges that have shaped our own lives.

6.txt,"A company has announced that it wishes to build a large factory near your community. This news has likely sparked a heated debate within the community, as the construction of a factory can have both advantages and disadvantages. It is important to carefully weigh these pros and cons before making a decision on whether or not to support the factory.
One potential advantage of the factory is that it could bring new jobs to the community. This could be particularly beneficial for those who are currently unemployed or underemployed, as the factory may offer higher paying and more stable positions. The factory could also generate additional tax revenue for the community, which could be used to fund necessary public services and infrastructure projects.
However, it is important to consider the potential negative impacts of the factory as well. For example, the factory may emit pollutants into the air and water, which could have negative effects on the environment and the health of community members. The factory may also generate noise and traffic, which could be a nuisance for those living in close proximity. Additionally, the factory may alter the landscape and character of the community, which could be a concern for those who value the aesthetic and cultural aspects of the area.
Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to support the factory will depend on the specific circumstances of the community and the willingness of the company to address and mitigate any potential negative impacts. It may be helpful to engage in a dialogue with community members and the company to discuss these concerns and come to a resolution that is in the best interest of all parties involved.",0.0,1.0,AI
83.txt,"Technology has undeniably had a significant impact on the world and the way we live. Some argue that it has made the world a better place to live, while others disagree. In this essay, I will argue that technology has indeed made the world a better place to live, and provide specific reasons and examples to support my opinion.
One of the main ways that technology has made the world a better place to live is by improving communication and connectivity. With the widespread use of the internet and social media, it is easier than ever before to stay in touch with people around the world. This has made it possible for people to maintain relationships with friends and loved ones who live far away, and has also made it easier for people to connect with others who share similar interests or goals. In addition, technology has made it possible for people to collaborate and work together remotely, which has made it easier for people to live and work in different parts of the world.
Another way that technology has made the world a better place to live is by improving access to information and education. The internet has made it possible for people to access a vast amount of information on virtually any topic, which has made it easier for people to learn new things and expand their knowledge. In addition, technology has made it possible for people to take online courses and earn degrees from top universities without ever leaving their homes. This has made education more accessible to people who may not have had the opportunity to attend a traditional brick-and-mortar school.
Technology has also made the world a better place to live by improving healthcare and increasing life expectancy. With the development of advanced medical technologies, such as electronic health records and telemedicine, healthcare providers are able to diagnose and treat patients more accurately and efficiently. In addition, technology has made it possible for people to monitor their own health and manage chronic conditions, such as diabetes or heart disease, from home. This has made it easier for people to stay healthy and live longer, more fulfilling lives.
Finally, technology has made the world a better place to live by improving transportation and making it easier for people to get around. With the development of electric and autonomous vehicles, it is now possible to travel long distances without relying on fossil fuels, which has reduced air pollution and made it easier for people to live in more environmentally friendly ways. In addition, ride-sharing services and public transportation apps have made it easier for people to get around without owning a car, which has made transportation more accessible and convenient for many people.
In conclusion, technology has made the world a better place to live in a number of ways. It has improved communication and connectivity, increased access to information and education, improved healthcare, and made transportation more convenient and environmentally friendly. While there are certainly valid concerns about the negative impacts of technology, the overall benefits of technology for society are undeniable.",0.0,1.0,AI
97.txt,"There is no doubt that the exploration of outer space has yielded tremendous benefits for humanity. The development of satellite technology has revolutionized telecommunications, weather forecasting, and navigation, among other things. The search for extraterrestrial life has also sparked public interest and curiosity about the universe.
However, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on our basic needs on Earth before investing in space exploration. The reason for this is simple: there are still millions of people on our planet who lack access to basic necessities such as clean water, healthcare, education, and nutritious food.
One of the main arguments for investing in space exploration is the potential economic benefits it could bring. While it is true that space-related industries have the potential to generate significant economic growth, it is important to consider the distribution of these benefits. Many space programs are funded and operated by governments, and the profits generated are often funneled back into the development of new technologies and missions, rather than being used to address pressing social and economic issues on Earth.
In contrast, investing in our basic needs on Earth has the potential to improve the lives of millions of people and create a more equitable and sustainable society. For example, investing in clean water infrastructure and sanitation can significantly reduce the burden of waterborne diseases, which disproportionately affect low-income communities. Similarly, investing in education and healthcare can provide people with the skills and knowledge they need to improve their lives and break the cycle of poverty.
In conclusion, while the exploration of outer space has brought numerous benefits to humanity, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on our basic needs on Earth. Investing in the well-being of our own planet and its inhabitants is essential for creating a more equitable and sustainable future for all.",0.0,1.0,AI
96.txt,"Dancing plays an important role in a culture. This statement is one that I fully agree with, as dancing has many important functions within a culture and can provide a variety of benefits for those who participate in it.
One reason why dancing is important in a culture is that it serves as a form of artistic expression. Through dance, people can communicate their feelings, emotions, and ideas in a way that words alone cannot. Dance can also be used to tell stories, whether they be historical, mythological, or personal. This allows individuals to connect with their culture and heritage in a meaningful way.
Another reason why dancing is important in a culture is that it can bring people together. Dance often involves group participation, whether it be in the form of a traditional folk dance or a modern hip hop performance. This shared experience can foster a sense of community and belonging, as people come together to celebrate and enjoy their culture.
In addition to these cultural benefits, dancing can also have numerous personal benefits. It can serve as a form of exercise and can help improve physical coordination and stamina. It can also be a great way to relieve stress and improve mental health. For these reasons, dancing can be an important part of a healthy lifestyle.
In conclusion, I believe that dancing plays an important role in a culture. It serves as a form of artistic expression, brings people together, and can have personal benefits as well.

There are many specific reasons why I think this custom would be valuable for people from other countries to adopt. First and foremost, the focus on enjoying simple pleasures and creating a sense of warmth and comfort can help to reduce stress and increase overall happiness. In today's fast-paced world, it can be easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle and forget to take the time to relax and appreciate the small things. By adopting the custom of hygge, people can make a conscious effort to slow down and savor the present moment, whether it's by lighting a candle, sipping on a warm beverage, or snuggling up with a good book.
Another reason why I think the custom of hygge would be beneficial for people from other countries is that it promotes a sense of community and togetherness. Many people in Denmark practice hygge by gathering with friends or loved ones and sharing in activities that bring a feeling of connection and companionship. This can be especially important in today's world, where technology and busy schedules can often make it difficult to maintain close relationships. By adopting the custom of hygge, people can make a concerted effort to prioritize social connections and build stronger bonds with those around them.

Currently, my hometown relies heavily on personal vehicle ownership for transportation. This can be a burden for those who cannot afford a car or do not have a driver's license. It can also contribute to traffic congestion and air pollution.
Having more public transportation options, such as buses or a train system, would greatly benefit the community. It would provide an alternative mode of transportation for those who cannot drive, and it would also reduce the number of cars on the road, leading to less traffic and a cleaner environment.
In addition, a robust public transportation system would make it easier for people to access job opportunities, schools, and other essential services that may be located outside of their immediate neighborhood.

However, I do not believe that it is the most important aspect of a job. In fact, there are several other factors that can contribute significantly to job satisfaction and overall happiness in one's career.
First and foremost, the work itself is often a major factor in job satisfaction. If a person is passionate about their work and finds it fulfilling, they are more likely to be happy in their job, regardless of the salary. On the other hand, if a person is miserable in their job because they do not enjoy the work or feel that it is not meaningful, a high salary may not be enough to compensate.
Additionally, the work environment and culture of a company can have a big impact on job satisfaction. If a person feels valued and supported by their coworkers and superiors, and if the company has a positive and inclusive culture, they are likely to feel more fulfilled in their job. In contrast, a toxic or unsupportive work environment can make even a high-paying job unbearable.
Finally, the balance between work and personal life is an important consideration. A job that allows for a healthy work-life balance and provides time for hobbies and personal pursuits can be more fulfilling than a job that requires long hours and constant overtime, even if it pays well.

41.txt,"There is no doubt that technology has revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the proliferation of the internet and the availability of a wide range of educational resources, students today have access to a wealth of knowledge at their fingertips. However, whether or not this necessarily means that they are able to learn more information and learn it more quickly is a more complex question.
On the one hand, it is certainly true that technology has made it easier for students to find and access information. In the past, students had to rely on textbooks, library books, and other physical sources of information, which could be time-consuming and inconvenient. Today, with the internet, students can find almost any information they need with just a few clicks of a button. This means that they can more easily research topics and complete assignments, which can lead to a deeper understanding of the material.
Furthermore, technology has also provided new tools and resources for teaching and learning. For example, online educational platforms, such as Coursera and Khan Academy, offer a wide range of courses and learning materials that are easily accessible to students. These platforms also often include interactive features, such as quizzes and exercises, which can help students to better retain and understand the material.
However, it is important to note that the availability of technology and information does not necessarily mean that students are using it effectively. Just because students have access to a wealth of information does not mean that they are necessarily able to understand and retain it. In fact, some research has shown that the constant distractions of technology, such as notifications and social media, can actually hinder learning and lead to a decline in attention span.
Furthermore, it is important to consider the role of the teacher in the learning process. While technology can certainly be a useful tool for teaching and learning, it is still the teacher who plays a crucial role in providing guidance and direction to the students. A good teacher can help students to better understand and retain the material, and can provide a more personalized learning experience.
In conclusion, while technology has certainly made it easier for students to access information and resources, it is not a magic solution for learning. Whether or not students are able to learn more information and learn it more quickly depends on a variety of factors, including how they use technology, their level of engagement and motivation, and the quality of their teacher.",0.0,1.0,AI

First and foremost, experienced workers have a proven track record of success in their field. They have already demonstrated their skills and abilities through previous work experiences, which means that they are more likely to be effective in their new role. In contrast, inexperienced workers may require significant training and supervision in order to reach the same level of productivity. This can be time-consuming and costly for the employer.
In addition, experienced workers often bring a wealth of knowledge and expertise to the table. They have likely encountered a variety of challenges and situations in their previous roles, which means that they are better equipped to handle unexpected issues that may arise. This can be especially valuable for an employer, as it can help to minimize disruptions and ensure that projects are completed efficiently and effectively.

One reason why some people are attracted to dangerous sports or activities is the thrill of excitement that they provide. Many people enjoy the rush of adrenaline that comes from participating in activities that are physically or mentally challenging. This thrill can be addictive, and some people may be drawn to dangerous activities in order to experience this feeling on a regular basis. For example, a person who enjoys skydiving or rock climbing may be attracted to these activities because of the excitement and thrill they provide.
Another reason why some people are attracted to dangerous activities is the desire for personal challenge. Many people are driven by a need to push themselves to their limits and to test the boundaries of their capabilities. Dangerous activities can provide a unique and challenging environment in which to do this, and some people may be attracted to these activities in order to test themselves and to see what they are capable of. For example, a person who is attracted to extreme sports such as base jumping or big wave surfing may be drawn to these activities because of the personal challenge they provide.
Finally, some people may be attracted to dangerous activities because of the sense of accomplishment that comes from overcoming fear and danger. Many people find a sense of pride and fulfillment in facing and conquering their fears, and dangerous activities can provide a unique opportunity to do this. By participating in activities that are physically or mentally challenging, people can learn to overcome their fears and to take on new challenges.

One of the main reasons that face-to-face communication is superior is that it allows for the most accurate form of communication. When we communicate in person, we can use a variety of nonverbal cues, such as body language and facial expressions, to convey meaning and intent. These nonverbal cues can often provide additional context and help us better understand the person we are communicating with. Additionally, face-to-face communication allows for immediate feedback and clarification, as we can ask questions and have them answered in real-time.
Another advantage of face-to-face communication is that it promotes stronger relationships. When we communicate with others in person, we are able to build a deeper connection with them through shared experiences and more meaningful interactions. This can lead to more trust and understanding between individuals, which is especially important in professional and personal relationships.
However, it is important to note that face-to-face communication is not always possible or practical. In some cases, other forms of communication, such as email or telephone calls, may be more efficient or convenient. For example, if we need to communicate with someone who is located in a different time zone or country, it may be easier to send an email or make a phone call.
Overall, while other forms of communication have their own advantages, I believe that face-to-face communication is generally the most effective and meaningful way to communicate with others.

3.txt,"Parents are often considered the best teachers because they are the first role models that children have and they spend a significant amount of time with their children. However, I believe that while parents can certainly play a crucial role in a child's education and development, they are not necessarily the best teachers for every subject or topic.
On one hand, there are many reasons why parents can be the best teachers for their children. Firstly, parents have a deep understanding of their child's needs, abilities, and learning style. They can tailor their teaching methods to suit their child's individual needs and provide support and encouragement when needed. Secondly, parents have a unique and special bond with their children, which can create a positive and supportive learning environment. This can make it easier for children to ask questions, seek help, and feel confident in their learning.
Additionally, parents can teach their children valuable life lessons and impart their own values and beliefs. They can also provide practical knowledge and skills that may not be taught in school, such as budgeting, cooking, and maintaining a household.
However, there are also some limitations to the idea that parents are the best teachers for every subject. While parents may have a strong foundation in certain areas, they may not have the necessary knowledge or expertise to teach their children more advanced or specialized subjects. For example, a parent who is a skilled musician may be able to teach their child the basics of music theory and how to play an instrument, but they may not have the training or experience to teach more advanced music theory or technique.
Furthermore, parents may not always have the time or resources to provide their children with a well-rounded education. They may not have access to the same resources or materials that schools do, or they may not have the knowledge or expertise to teach their children certain subjects. In these cases, it may be beneficial for children to seek additional education and support from other sources, such as teachers or tutors.
In conclusion, while parents can certainly play a crucial role in a child's education and development, they are not necessarily the best teachers for every subject or topic.

79.txt,"There is a longstanding debate over whether or not boys and girls should attend separate schools. On one hand, some argue that separating boys and girls can lead to a more focused and effective education, as teachers can tailor their lessons to the specific needs and learning styles of either gender. Others argue that separating boys and girls can perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes and limit the social and emotional development of students.
Personally, I disagree with the statement that boys and girls should attend separate schools. While there may be some benefits to separating students by gender, the drawbacks far outweigh them.
One reason I disagree with separating boys and girls in schools is that it can perpetuate harmful gender stereotypes. When boys and girls are separated, they may be subject to different expectations and standards based on their gender, which can lead to the reinforcement of gender roles and stereotypes. For example, girls may be encouraged to focus on more traditionally ""feminine"" subjects, such as literature and art, while boys may be encouraged to focus on more traditionally ""masculine"" subjects, such as math and science. This separation can reinforce harmful ideas about what activities and subjects are appropriate for each gender, which can have long-term consequences on students' self-esteem, career choices, and relationships.
Another reason I disagree with separating boys and girls in schools is that it can limit the social and emotional development of students. When boys and girls are separated, they may miss out on important opportunities to interact with and learn from each other. This can lead to a lack of understanding and empathy between the two genders, which can have negative impacts on relationships and communication in the long run. In addition, separating boys and girls can also limit students' exposure to diversity and prevent them from learning how to effectively communicate and work with people from different backgrounds.
In conclusion, while there may be some benefits to separating boys and girls in schools, I believe that the drawbacks far outweigh them.

On one hand, it can be argued that the Internet provides people with a wealth of valuable information that was previously unavailable or difficult to access. For example, with just a few clicks, one can find detailed explanations on a wide range of topics, access primary sources, and connect with experts in their field of interest. Additionally, the Internet allows for quick and easy communication, making it easier for people to collaborate and share ideas with others around the world.
On the other hand, it can also be argued that access to so much information creates problems. One problem is the issue of misinformation and fake news. With the proliferation of social media platforms and the ability to easily share information online, it can be difficult for people to differentiate between credible sources and biased or misleading content. This can lead to the spread of misinformation, which can have serious consequences, such as influencing public opinion or causing harm to individuals.
Another problem is the issue of overload. With so much information available online, it can be overwhelming for people to sort through and determine what is relevant and accurate. This can lead to information overload, which can be mentally exhausting and make it difficult for people to make informed decisions.
In conclusion, while the Internet provides people with access to a wealth of valuable information, it also creates problems such as the spread of misinformation and information overload. It is important for individuals to be critical of the information they access online and to be mindful of the potential negative consequences of having access to so much information.",0.0,1.0,AI

The bald eagle is important to my country for several reasons. First, the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of American freedom and independence. The bald eagle was chosen as the national symbol because it is known for its strength, courage, and majesty, and it represents the ideals of liberty and democracy that are at the heart of our nation.
Second, the bald eagle is an important part of our natural heritage.

The bald eagle is a top predator and plays a vital role in maintaining the health and balance of our ecosystems.
Third, the bald eagle is a conservation success story. In the 20th century, the population of bald eagles in the United States declined dramatically due to habitat loss, hunting, and the use of DDT, a harmful insecticide. However, thanks to conservation efforts, the bald eagle was able to recover and was removed from the endangered species list in 2007. Today, the bald eagle is a thriving species and a symbol of the resilience and determination of the American people.

One of the main reasons for this is that the capital city is typically a hub for culture and history, and it can offer a taste of the country's unique identity. For example, my country's capital city has a number of museums, galleries, and historical landmarks that showcase our rich history and cultural heritage. These include a renowned art museum, a colonial-era fort, and a number of churches and cathedrals that are architectural marvels.
In addition to the cultural and historical attractions, the capital city also offers a range of other activities and entertainment options. There are numerous restaurants and cafes that serve a variety of local and international cuisines, as well as shopping districts and markets where visitors can purchase handmade crafts and souvenirs.
Furthermore, the capital city is a convenient choice for a one-day visit because it is usually well-connected by transportation, with an efficient public transportation system and a number of taxi and ride-sharing options. This makes it easy for the visitor to get around and see as much as possible within a limited time frame.

78.txt,"I strongly agree that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. There are several reasons why this is an important and beneficial decision for children.
First and foremost, learning a foreign language at an early age has been shown to have numerous cognitive benefits. It has been found that children who study a foreign language tend to perform better on standardized tests, have improved memory and problem-solving skills, and even score higher on verbal and math sections of the SAT. These benefits are likely due to the fact that learning a foreign language requires the development of new neural connections, which helps to improve overall brain function.
In addition to the cognitive benefits, learning a foreign language at a young age can also have social and cultural benefits. Children who are exposed to different languages and cultures at an early age tend to be more open-minded and accepting of other cultures, which can be valuable in today's increasingly globalized world. Children who speak more than one language also have an advantage when it comes to future job opportunities, as being bilingual or multilingual is often viewed as a valuable skill in many industries.
There are also practical benefits to starting foreign language learning at an early age. Children tend to be more receptive to learning new languages when they are young, and they often find it easier to pick up new languages than adults do. This means that they can make progress more quickly and achieve a higher level of proficiency in a shorter amount of time.
In conclusion, I believe that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. The cognitive, social, and practical benefits of doing so make it a valuable investment in a child's future.",0.0,1.0,AI
50.txt,"There are many reasons why people work beyond the need for money to live. One such reason is the sense of accomplishment and fulfillment that comes from doing meaningful work. For many people, their job is an important part of their identity and contributes to their sense of purpose in life.
For example, a teacher may work not just for the salary, but because they derive satisfaction from helping students learn and grow. Similarly, a scientist may be motivated by the desire to make new discoveries and contribute to the advancement of their field.
Another reason people work is for the opportunity to learn and grow. Many jobs offer training and development opportunities that allow employees to acquire new skills and advance their careers. For example, a salesperson may take on additional responsibilities within the company, such as managing a team or developing new business strategies, in order to expand their knowledge and expertise.
Another reason people work is for the social connections and relationships that are formed through their job. For many people, their coworkers and colleagues become an important part of their social support network and provide a sense of belonging and community. For example, a nurse may work not just for the salary, but because they enjoy the camaraderie of their colleagues and the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of their patients.
Finally, some people work for the opportunity to give back and make a positive impact on their community or the world. For example, a social worker may be motivated by the desire to help others and make a positive difference in their clients' lives.

52.txt,"As a general rule, I prefer to try new things and take risks. While it is certainly enjoyable and rewarding to do what one already does well, I believe that the benefits of trying new things and taking risks far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
One reason why I prefer to try new things and take risks is that it allows me to learn and grow. When we do the same things over and over again, we may become comfortable and proficient in those tasks, but we do not necessarily challenge ourselves to learn and improve. On the other hand, by trying new things and taking risks, we expose ourselves to new experiences and challenges that can help us develop new skills and broaden our perspectives. For example, if I were to always stick to the things I already do well, I might never have the opportunity to learn how to play a musical instrument or speak a new language. By stepping out of my comfort zone and taking on these new challenges, however, I have the opportunity to learn and grow in ways that I might not have otherwise.
Another reason why I prefer to try new things and take risks is that it can lead to greater fulfillment and satisfaction. When we do the same things all the time, it can become monotonous and boring. On the other hand, trying new things and taking risks can add excitement and novelty to our lives, and it can be incredibly satisfying to succeed at something that we have never done before. For example, if I were to always stick to the things I already do well, I might never have the opportunity to try bungee jumping or skydiving, both of which are activities that I have always wanted to do. By taking the risk and trying these new things, I not only have the opportunity to enjoy the thrill of the experience, but I also have the satisfaction of knowing that I accomplished something that I never thought I could.
In conclusion, while it is certainly enjoyable and rewarding to do what one already does well, I believe that the benefits of trying new things and taking risks far outweigh any potential drawbacks.

46.txt,"There are benefits to both traveling with a companion and traveling alone. Personally, I prefer to travel alone because it allows me to have more control over my itinerary and schedule, and it allows me to fully immerse myself in the experience of being in a new place.
One of the main reasons I prefer to travel alone is that it allows me to have more control over my itinerary. When I am traveling with someone else, there is often a need to compromise and come to a consensus about what activities to do and how much time to spend at each location. While this can be enjoyable and can lead to new experiences, it can also be frustrating if I have a specific list of things that I want to do and see. When I am traveling alone, I have the freedom to do exactly what I want and go at my own pace.
Another reason I prefer to travel alone is that it allows me to fully immerse myself in the experience of being in a new place. When I am with a companion, I often find myself spending more time interacting with them and less time observing and experiencing my surroundings. When I am alone, I have the opportunity to truly take in everything that a new place has to offer and fully engage with the culture and people around me.
There are, of course, also benefits to traveling with a companion. For example, it can be more enjoyable to have someone to share the experience with, and it can also be safer to have someone with you in case of any emergencies. Additionally, traveling with a companion can be more cost-effective as you can split the cost of accommodations and transportation.
Ultimately, whether to travel with a companion or alone is a personal decision that depends on an individual's preferences and circumstances.

He was not only a brilliant artist, but also a scientist, inventor, and engineer. His contributions to the fields of anatomy, engineering, and architecture were groundbreaking, and his works of art, such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, are still considered some of the greatest masterpieces of all time.

With the proliferation of the internet and social media, it is easier than ever for people to access information and connect with others across cultural and geographical boundaries. As a result, some people argue that modern technology is creating a single world culture, in which people from different cultures are increasingly influenced by and exposed to the same ideas and norms.
However, I disagree with the statement that modern technology is creating a single world culture. While it is true that technology has made it easier for people to access information and connect with others around the world, it has also allowed people to maintain and celebrate their unique cultural identities.
For example, consider the role of social media in promoting cultural traditions and customs. Many people use social media platforms to share photos, videos, and stories about their cultural practices and celebrations, allowing others to learn about and appreciate the diversity of cultures around the world. This is especially true for marginalized or minority cultures that may not have as much representation in mainstream media.
Furthermore, technology has also allowed people to easily connect with and engage in online communities centered around specific cultural identities or interests. These communities provide a space for people to share their experiences, traditions, and values with others who share similar backgrounds, further reinforcing their cultural identities.
In addition, modern technology has not necessarily led to a homogenization of cultural practices or values. While it is true that people around the world may be exposed to similar ideas and trends through the internet and social media, they are also free to choose which ones they adopt and which ones they reject. For example, while some people may embrace Western fashion trends, others may prefer to maintain traditional clothing styles. Similarly, while some people may adopt Western cultural practices, others may maintain their own traditional customs and traditions.

152.txt,"One important natural resource that is disappearing at an alarming rate is forests. Forests provide a range of benefits to both people and the environment, and their loss can have serious consequences.
One reason forests need to be saved is that they provide vital ecosystem services. Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and produce oxygen, making them an important part of the planet's carbon cycle. They also act as natural filters for water, helping to purify and regulate the flow of water in rivers and streams. In addition, forests provide habitat for a wide range of plant and animal species, many of which are endangered and at risk of extinction if their habitats are destroyed.
Another reason forests need to be preserved is that they have significant economic value. Forests are a source of timber, which is used for construction and other purposes. In addition, forests support a range of industries, including tourism, which can provide jobs and income for local communities.
There are also cultural and social reasons to save forests. Many indigenous communities depend on forests for their livelihoods, and the loss of forests can have a devastating impact on their way of life. In addition, forests are often considered sacred by indigenous communities, and their destruction can have spiritual and emotional consequences.
There are several ways that forests can be preserved and protected. One approach is through the creation of national parks and other protected areas, which can help to safeguard forests from logging and other forms of development. Another approach is through the promotion of sustainable forestry practices, which allow for the harvesting of timber in a way that is environmentally responsible and promotes the long-term health of forests.
In conclusion, forests are a vital natural resource that need to be saved for the sake of both the environment and the people who depend on them. Their loss can have serious consequences, including the loss of vital ecosystem services, economic disruption, and cultural and social upheaval.

One way that advertising can tell you a lot about a country is through the products and services being advertised. For example, if a country has a strong agricultural industry, you may see a lot of advertisements for farm equipment or agricultural chemicals. On the other hand, if a country has a thriving tech industry, you may see a lot of ads for smartphones and other gadgets. By examining the types of products and services being advertised, you can get a sense of the industries and sectors that are driving the economy of a particular country.
Another way that advertising can provide insight into a country is through the messages and themes that are emphasized in ads. For example, if you see a lot of ads that focus on family values, traditional gender roles, and a strong work ethic, this may indicate that these values are important to the society in question. On the other hand, if you see a lot of ads that focus on individualism, self-expression, and social justice, this may indicate that these values are more prominent in the culture of the country.
Additionally, the way that advertising is regulated in a country can also tell you a lot about its society. For example, if a country has strict regulations on advertising to children, this may indicate a concern for protecting the well-being and innocence of young people. On the other hand, if a country has more lenient regulations on advertising, this may indicate a belief in the power of consumer choice and the importance of free market capitalism.

90.txt,"Telephones and email have certainly revolutionized the way we communicate with one another, but whether or not they have made communication less personal is a matter of debate.
On one hand, it could be argued that telephones and email have made communication more convenient and efficient. With just a phone call or an email, we can instantly reach someone anywhere in the world, at any time of day. We no longer have to wait for letters to be delivered or make long journeys to visit someone in person. This has made it easier to stay in touch with friends and family, even when we are physically apart.
However, some people argue that the convenience of telephones and email has led to a decrease in face-to-face communication and a corresponding loss of personal connection. It is true that we are now more likely to communicate with others through a screen or over the phone, rather than in person. This can make it harder to pick up on nonverbal cues and can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications.
Additionally, the impersonal nature of email and text messaging can make it easier for people to be rude or insensitive in their communication. Without the social cues of in-person interactions, it can be harder to gauge the tone of a message and people may be more likely to say things they wouldn't say in person.
Overall, while telephones and email have certainly made communication more convenient, they have also had some negative effects on the personal nature of communication.

One reason I prefer to get up early is that it allows me to have a clear and focused mind in the morning. When I wake up early, I have the opportunity to start my day with a fresh perspective and a clear head. This helps me to be more productive and focused as I tackle my tasks for the day.
Another reason I prefer to get up early is that it allows me to get a head start on the day. By getting up early and starting my day's work, I am able to get a jump on my tasks and responsibilities. This means that I can potentially get more work done in a shorter amount of time, which can be especially helpful if I have a lot on my plate.
Additionally, getting up early allows me to have a more structured and predictable routine. When I have a regular schedule of getting up early and starting my work, I am able to plan my days more effectively and get into a rhythm. This can help me to be more efficient and productive overall.
Of course, there are also some drawbacks to getting up early. For example, it can be challenging to get enough sleep if I go to bed too late the night before. However, I find that the benefits of getting up early far outweigh any potential drawbacks.
In conclusion, while some people may prefer to get up later in the day and work until late at night, I personally prefer to get up early in the morning and start the day's work.

53.txt,"Success in life can come from a combination of taking risks and careful planning. While it is true that some people have achieved success through taking bold and calculated risks, others have found success through diligent and systematic planning. Ultimately, the path to success will vary from person to person and will depend on an individual's unique strengths, skills, and circumstances.
On the one hand, taking risks can be a crucial factor in achieving success. This can involve stepping out of one's comfort zone and trying something new or taking a chance on an opportunity that may seem uncertain or risky. For example, an entrepreneur who starts a new business venture is taking a risk, as there is no guarantee of success. However, if the entrepreneur is able to identify a market need and develop a product or service that meets that need, their risk-taking could lead to significant success. Similarly, an individual who pursues a career in a creative field, such as the arts or entertainment, may need to take risks in order to stand out and succeed in a competitive industry.
On the other hand, careful planning is also essential for achieving success. This can involve setting clear goals and developing a roadmap to achieve them, as well as anticipating and managing potential challenges and obstacles. For example, a student who wants to get into a top university may need to carefully plan their course of study, extracurricular activities, and test preparation in order to increase their chances of acceptance. Similarly, a business owner who wants to grow their company may need to create a detailed business plan that outlines their strategies for marketing, sales, and financial management.
In conclusion, success in life can come from both taking risks and careful planning. While one approach may work better for some people, it is important to find the balance that works best for you. By considering both the potential rewards and risks of different courses of action, and by combining the creativity and flexibility of risk-taking with the discipline and focus of careful planning, you can increase your chances of achieving success in your personal and professional endeavors.",0.0,1.0,AI
20.txt,"The question of whether governments should spend more money on improving roads and highways or on improving public transportation is a complex one that has generated a lot of debate. While there are compelling arguments to be made for both approaches, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on public transportation.
One of the main reasons for this is that improving public transportation can have a number of positive impacts on society. For example, better public transportation can make it easier for people to get to work or school, which can help to increase productivity and improve economic growth. It can also provide people with more affordable and convenient travel options, which can help to reduce traffic congestion and air pollution. Additionally, improved public transportation can help to promote social inclusion by providing access to opportunities for those who may not have access to a car or other private transportation.
Another reason to prioritize spending on public transportation is that it can be more cost-effective than spending on roads and highways. While building new roads and highways can be expensive, public transportation systems can often be built and maintained at a lower cost. Additionally, public transportation systems can serve a larger number of people, which means that the cost per person can be lower than the cost of building and maintaining roads and highways.
Furthermore, investing in public transportation can also have long-term benefits for the environment. Public transportation systems typically produce lower levels of greenhouse gas emissions than private cars, which can help to combat climate change. Additionally, public transportation can help to reduce the need for car ownership, which can free up land for other uses and help to reduce urban sprawl.
Overall, I believe that governments should prioritize spending on improving public transportation over spending on improving roads and highways. While both approaches have their merits, public transportation has the potential to provide a range of benefits for society, including improved productivity, reduced traffic congestion, and a healthier environment.",0.0,1.0,AI

One example of this can be seen in the way people dress for work. Many people tend to dress more formally for the office, wearing suits and dresses, and this can often lead to a shift in their behavior. They may feel more professional and serious in their work attire, leading to a more formal and business-like demeanor. On the other hand, when people dress more casually, such as in jeans and a t-shirt, they may feel more relaxed and informal, leading to a more casual and laid-back behavior.
Another example can be seen in the way people behave when they are participating in different activities or events. For instance, when people attend a formal event, such as a wedding or a black-tie affair, they often dress in formal attire, such as a tuxedo or a formal gown. This can lead to a change in their behavior, as they may feel more sophisticated and refined in their formal attire, leading to a more poised and elegant demeanor. On the other hand, when people attend a more casual event, such as a barbecue or a beach party, they may dress in more casual clothing, such as shorts and a tank top. This can lead to a more relaxed and laid-back behavior, as they feel more comfortable in their casual attire.
In conclusion, it is clear that clothing can influence the way people behave. Whether it is the formal attire of a business setting or the casual clothing of a relaxed event, the clothes we wear can have a significant impact on our behavior and attitude.

They argue that a college or university education can provide individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to secure good jobs and improve their quality of life.
On the other hand, those who believe that higher education should be available only to good students argue that college and university resources are limited, and that these resources should be prioritized for students who are most likely to succeed. They argue that students who are not academically talented or motivated should not be given the opportunity to attend college or university, as they may struggle to keep up with the demands of higher education and may ultimately end up dropping out.
Personally, I agree with the view that higher education should be available to all students. While it is true that some students may struggle more than others to succeed in higher education, I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education if they so choose. Higher education can be a transformative experience that helps individuals develop new skills and knowledge, and it can open up doors to new career opportunities and a better quality of life.
Furthermore, I believe that making higher education available to all students can have a positive impact on society as a whole. A more educated population can contribute to the overall prosperity and development of a country, and it can help to address social and economic inequalities. Additionally, I believe that everyone should have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and goals, regardless of their academic abilities.
In conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides of the debate, I believe that higher education should be available to all students. Everyone should have the opportunity to pursue higher education and gain the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the modern world.",0.0,1.0,AI
108.txt,"There are many different ways to travel from your home to a place 40 miles away. Some options include driving a car, taking a bus or train, riding a bike, or walking. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs and preferences.
One option for traveling to your destination is to drive a car. This can be a convenient and relatively fast way to get there, especially if you have your own vehicle. However, driving a car also has some downsides. It can be expensive, especially if you have to pay for gas, and it can also be harmful to the environment due to emissions. In addition, driving a car can be stressful, especially if you have to deal with traffic or bad weather.
Another option is to take a bus or train. Public transportation can be a cheaper and more environmentally friendly way to travel, as it reduces the number of cars on the road and the associated emissions. It can also be a good choice if you don't have a car or don't want to deal with the stress of driving. However, public transportation can be less convenient than driving, as it may not go directly to your destination and may require you to transfer to multiple modes of transportation.
Riding a bike is another option for traveling to your destination. This can be a great way to get exercise and enjoy the outdoors, and it can also be environmentally friendly. However, riding a bike can be more physically demanding than other modes of transportation, and it may not be practical if you have a lot of luggage or if the weather is bad.
Walking is another option for traveling to your destination, although it is likely to be the slowest and most physically demanding way to get there. However, walking can also be a great way to get exercise and enjoy the outdoors, and it has the added benefit of being completely environmentally friendly.
After considering all of these options, I would choose to take a bus or train to my destination. I think this would be the most convenient and environmentally friendly way to get there, as it would allow me to avoid the stress of driving and the physical demands of biking or walking. I would also appreciate the opportunity to relax and read or listen to music during the journey.",0.0,1.0,AI
120.txt,"There are two approaches to life that people tend to adopt: enjoying change and seeking new experiences, or preferring stability and maintaining usual habits. Both approaches have their own benefits and drawbacks, and which one a person prefers often depends on their personality, values, and life circumstances.
Those who enjoy change and look forward to new experiences tend to be more open-minded and adventurous. They embrace the unknown and embrace new opportunities as they come. This approach to life can lead to exciting and enriching experiences, as well as personal growth and self-discovery. It can also be a source of stress and uncertainty, as change can bring with it risks and challenges.
On the other hand, those who prefer stability and maintaining their usual habits may value predictability and routine. They may find comfort in the familiar and may not enjoy stepping outside their comfort zone. This approach to life can provide a sense of security and stability, but it can also lead to a lack of growth and stagnation.
Personally, I prefer a balance between the two approaches. While I enjoy trying new things and experiencing new things, I also value stability and routine in certain areas of my life. I believe that a mix of both approaches allows for a fulfilling and well-rounded life.

134.txt,"I agree that children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. Here are several specific reasons why:
First and foremost, helping with household tasks helps children to develop important life skills. These skills include things like responsibility, time management, and problem-solving. By participating in tasks like setting the table, doing the dishes, and taking out the trash, children learn to take ownership of their actions and the consequences that come with them. They also learn to manage their time effectively by completing tasks in a timely manner and to problem-solve when faced with unexpected challenges, such as finding a missing sock or figuring out how to clean a particularly stubborn stain.
Another reason why children should be required to help with household tasks is that it promotes a sense of teamwork and cooperation within the family. When children contribute to the upkeep of the household, they feel like valued members of the family and are more likely to pitch in when needed. This sense of teamwork and cooperation can have a positive impact on family dynamics and can help to build stronger bonds between family members.
Finally, requiring children to help with household tasks can also help to reduce stress and workload on parents. With both parents often working outside of the home and with busy schedules, it can be overwhelming for one or both parents to manage all of the household tasks on their own. By assigning age-appropriate tasks to children and holding them accountable for completing them, parents can delegate some of the workload and have a little extra time for themselves.
In conclusion, I believe that children should be required to help with household tasks as soon as they are able to do so. Not only does it help them develop important life skills, promote teamwork and cooperation within the family, and reduce stress on parents, but it also teaches children the value of hard work and the importance of contributing to the household.",0.0,1.0,AI
21.txt,"There are valid arguments for both sides of this debate, and ultimately the decision of whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city depends on individual circumstances and priorities.
On one hand, growing up in the countryside has several advantages. For one, children who live in rural areas often have more opportunities to be outside and engage in physical activities, such as playing sports, hiking, or exploring nature. This can promote healthy habits and a love of the outdoors that may not be as readily available in a city setting.
Additionally, the pace of life in the countryside is often slower and more relaxed than in a big city, which can provide a more peaceful and stress-free environment for children to grow up in. Children who grow up in rural areas may also have a stronger sense of community and may be more connected to their neighbors and extended family.
On the other hand, there are also many benefits to growing up in a big city. For one, cities often offer a wider range of educational and cultural opportunities for children. There may be more diverse schools and extracurricular activities available, as well as access to museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions.
In addition, living in a city can provide children with exposure to different cultures and ways of life, which can broaden their perspective and understanding of the world. This can be especially valuable for children who may not have the opportunity to travel as much.
Ultimately, the decision of whether it is better for children to grow up in the countryside or in a big city depends on individual circumstances and priorities. Some families may value the slower pace of life and close-knit community of the countryside, while others may prioritize access to educational and cultural opportunities in the city. It is important for families to carefully consider their own values and needs when making this decision.",0.0,1.0,AI
35.txt,"There are valid arguments on both sides of the debate over whether businesses should hire employees for their entire lives. Some believe that long-term employment allows for increased productivity and loyalty, while others argue that it limits a company's flexibility and opportunities for growth. Ultimately, it is important for businesses to carefully consider the pros and cons of long-term employment and make a decision that is best for both the company and its employees.
One argument in favor of hiring employees for their entire lives is that it can lead to increased productivity and loyalty. When employees know that they have a secure job for the long term, they may be more motivated to work hard and contribute to the company's success. In addition, long-term employees often have a deep understanding of the company's culture and processes, which can make them more efficient and effective in their roles. Moreover, employees who feel secure in their jobs may be more likely to stay with the company for the long haul, resulting in lower turnover rates and the associated costs of training new employees.
On the other hand, some argue that hiring employees for their entire lives can limit a company's flexibility and opportunities for growth. For example, if a company is facing economic challenges or needs to pivot its business model, it may need to reduce its workforce or make other changes to adapt. If a company has a large number of long-term employees, it may be more difficult to make these changes. In addition, hiring employees for their entire lives may limit the company's ability to bring in new perspectives and ideas from outside candidates. This can be particularly important in fast-paced industries that require constant innovation.
In conclusion, while there are certainly benefits to hiring employees for their entire lives, it is important for businesses to carefully weigh the pros and cons and make a decision that is best for both the company and its employees. In some cases, long-term employment may be the right choice, while in others, a more flexible approach may be necessary. Ultimately, the decision will depend on the specific needs and goals of the business.",0.0,1.0,AI
23.txt,"There are many important characteristics that a co-worker should possess in order to be a successful member of a team.
First and foremost, a co-worker should be reliable and dependable. This means that they show up to work on time, complete their tasks and assignments as agreed upon, and are reliable in their communication with the team. In a work setting, reliability is crucial because it allows the team to depend on each other and ensures that projects and tasks are completed efficiently. For example, if a co-worker consistently misses deadlines or does not follow through on their responsibilities, it can create problems for the rest of the team and ultimately hinder the success of the project.
Another important characteristic of a co-worker is being a good team player. This means that they are willing to work with others and contribute to the team's goals, rather than just focusing on their own individual tasks. Being a good team player involves being willing to help out others, share ideas and resources, and collaborate effectively. This is important because it helps to create a positive and supportive work environment, where everyone is working towards a common goal and supporting each other.
In addition, a co-worker should be adaptable and flexible. This means that they are able to adapt to changing circumstances and are willing to try new approaches when needed. This is important because work environments are often dynamic and unpredictable, and being able to adapt to change is crucial in order to be successful. For example, if a project requires a different approach than what was originally planned, an adaptable co-worker would be able to pivot and find a new solution, rather than becoming stuck or resistant to change.
Another important characteristic of a co-worker is being respectful and professional. This means treating others with kindness, consideration, and professionalism, even when faced with challenges or conflicts. Respect and professionalism are important in the workplace because they help to create a positive and harmonious work environment, where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. This is especially important in a team setting, where everyone is working closely together and relying on each other.
Overall, there are many important characteristics that a co-worker should possess in order to be a successful member of a team.

37.txt,"One transportation vehicle that has significantly changed people's lives is the automobile. The invention of the automobile has allowed people to easily and quickly travel long distances, facilitating the development of suburbs and enabling people to live further away from their places of work.
Before the invention of the automobile, people were largely confined to living and working in close proximity to each other, as the primary modes of transportation were horses, trains, and boats. These modes of transportation were either slow or limited in their ability to travel over land. The invention of the automobile, with its ability to quickly and easily travel long distances on land, opened up new possibilities for where people could live and work.
The automobile also greatly increased the speed at which people could travel. Whereas a horse-drawn carriage might travel at a speed of only a few miles per hour, an automobile can travel at speeds of over 60 miles per hour. This increased speed has allowed people to travel longer distances in a shorter amount of time, making it possible to live further away from the city and still be able to commute to work.
The widespread adoption of the automobile has also led to the development of new industries and job opportunities. The automotive industry, which includes the manufacturing of automobiles as well as the production of gasoline and other fuels, has become a major contributor to the economy. Additionally, the growth of the automobile industry has led to the creation of jobs in fields such as automotive repair and maintenance, car sales, and traffic control.
In conclusion, the automobile has greatly changed people's lives by providing them with the ability to easily and quickly travel long distances.

122.txt,"It is not accurate to say that decisions made quickly are always wrong. While it is true that careful thought and consideration can often lead to better decisions, there are also situations where quick decision-making is necessary and can result in the right choice.
One reason why quick decisions are not always wrong is that they can be based on past experience and knowledge. For example, a firefighter who has been trained to respond to emergencies quickly and make decisions under pressure is likely to make the right choice in a crisis situation, even if they don't have time to think carefully about their options. Similarly, a skilled athlete who has practiced a particular move many times may be able to make a quick decision to execute that move in a game, even if they don't have time to consider other options.
Another reason why quick decisions are not always wrong is that they can be guided by intuition or gut instincts, which can be valuable in certain situations. For example, a parent may have a strong sense that their child is in danger and needs to be rescued, even if they don't have time to consider all the options. In this case, the parent's quick decision to act on their intuition may turn out to be the right choice.
Of course, it is also important to consider the potential risks and consequences of making a quick decision. In some cases, taking the time to carefully weigh the pros and cons of different options may be the best course of action. However, it is not accurate to say that quick decisions are always wrong.

123.txt,"First impressions can often be influential in how we perceive and interact with others. Some people trust their initial assessments of a person's character because they believe these judgments are generally correct. On the other hand, others do not judge a person's character quickly because they believe first impressions are often wrong. In this essay, I will compare these two attitudes and explain why I agree with the latter.
One argument in favor of trusting first impressions is that they are based on our instincts and intuition, which can be finely tuned through experience and exposure to different people and situations. These instincts and intuitions may be able to pick up on subtle cues and behaviors that reveal a person's true character, even if they are trying to put up a front or present a false image. For example, if we meet someone who is friendly and warm, we may instinctively trust them and feel comfortable around them, even if we do not know them well.
However, relying solely on first impressions can also lead to biases and prejudices that may not be accurate or fair. People are complex and multifaceted, and it is difficult to fully understand their character based on a few initial interactions. Furthermore, first impressions are often influenced by societal norms, expectations, and stereotypes, which can distort our perceptions and lead us to make judgments that are not based on reality.
For example, if we meet someone who is dressed in a certain way or has a particular accent, we may automatically assume certain things about their character based on these superficial characteristics. This can lead to misunderstandings and prejudices that prevent us from getting to know someone truly and forming a genuine connection with them.
In my opinion, the best approach is to not judge a person's character quickly and instead take the time to get to know them before forming an opinion. This allows us to see the full range of their personality and characteristics and make a more informed and balanced assessment of their character.
Of course, this does not mean that we should blindly trust everyone we meet and ignore any red flags or warning signs. It simply means that we should approach people with an open mind and be willing to give them the benefit of the doubt until we have sufficient evidence to the contrary.
In conclusion, while trusting first impressions may be tempting, relying solely on them can lead to biases and prejudices that are not accurate or fair. A more balanced and nuanced approach is to not judge a person's character quickly and instead take the time to get to know them before forming an opinion. This allows us to see the full range of their personality and characteristics and make a more informed and balanced assessment of their character.",0.0,1.0,AI
36.txt,"There is no doubt that attending a live performance can be an incredibly enjoyable experience. The energy and excitement of being in the same physical space as the performers, as well as the opportunity to immerse oneself in the atmosphere of the event, can add a level of enjoyment that is simply not possible when watching the same event on television.
One reason why attending a live performance can be more enjoyable is the sense of community that it provides. When watching an event on television, one is essentially a spectator, sitting alone or with a small group of people and observing from a distance. However, when attending a live performance, one becomes part of a larger group of people all united in their love for the event. This sense of shared experience and connection to others can add an extra layer of enjoyment to the event.
Another reason why attending a live performance can be more enjoyable is the opportunity to engage with the event on a deeper level. When watching an event on television, one is often limited to a fixed camera angle and may not get a full sense of the event as it unfolds. In contrast, attending a live performance allows one to move around and experience the event from different perspectives, making it a more immersive and interactive experience. Additionally, the ability to see and hear the event in person allows for a more nuanced appreciation of the performers and their talents.
Finally, attending a live performance can simply be more memorable and special than watching the same event on television. The memories and emotions associated with being at a live event can last a lifetime, and can be something to look back on with pride and joy. In contrast, watching an event on television may be enjoyable in the moment, but it may not leave the same lasting impact.

22.txt,"There are several reasons why people are living longer now than in the past. One of the main reasons is advances in medical technology. With the development of new drugs and treatments, people are able to manage and treat a variety of diseases and conditions that would have been fatal in the past. For example, antibiotics have greatly reduced the number of deaths from bacterial infections, while immunizations have prevented the spread of diseases such as polio and measles.
Another reason for the increase in life expectancy is the improvement of living conditions. In the past, people often lived in unsanitary conditions that led to the spread of diseases. Today, most people have access to clean water, proper sanitation, and healthy living environments, which helps to prevent the spread of illness and disease.
In addition, people are now more aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle. Many people engage in regular exercise, eat a healthy diet, and avoid risky behaviors such as smoking and excessive alcohol consumption, which can all contribute to a longer lifespan.
Finally, the increase in life expectancy is also due to advances in public health policies and programs. Governments and organizations have implemented various initiatives to improve the health and well-being of their citizens, such as providing access to healthcare and promoting healthy behaviors.
In conclusion, people are living longer now due to a combination of factors, including advances in medical technology, improvements in living conditions, a greater focus on healthy lifestyle choices, and effective public health policies and programs.

26.txt,"The announcement of a large shopping center being built in my neighborhood has sparked a debate among residents. While some see it as a convenient addition to the community, others worry about the potential negative impacts it could have. Personally, I oppose the plan to build a shopping center in my neighborhood.
One reason I oppose the shopping center is that it could increase traffic and congestion in the area. With more people coming to the shopping center, there will be more cars on the road, which could lead to longer commute times and more difficulty finding parking. This could be especially problematic for those who live near the shopping center and may have to deal with the added traffic on a daily basis.
In addition, the shopping center could also have negative impacts on local businesses. While the new shopping center may bring in some new customers, it could also take business away from smaller, locally owned stores in the area. These stores are often an integral part of the community and contribute to its unique character. Losing them could have a detrimental effect on the neighborhood.
Furthermore, the shopping center could also lead to environmental issues. The construction of the shopping center itself would likely result in the destruction of natural habitats and the release of greenhouse gases. The shopping center would also contribute to the problem of overconsumption and waste, as it would encourage people to buy more products that may eventually end up in landfills.

127.txt,"I agree that all students should be required to study art and music in secondary school. There are several reasons why this is important.
Firstly, art and music education can help students develop important skills such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. These skills are not only useful in the arts, but they can also be applied to other subjects and in life outside of school. For example, learning to play a musical instrument requires discipline, practice, and patience, which can help students develop strong work ethics. Similarly, creating a piece of art requires students to think creatively and come up with original ideas, which can help them develop problem-solving skills.
Secondly, art and music education can also help students develop their social and emotional skills. Participating in an art or music class can help students learn to work well with others, communicate effectively, and express themselves in a healthy and positive way. This can be especially beneficial for students who may struggle with social interactions or have difficulty expressing their emotions.
Finally, art and music education can also help students appreciate and understand different cultures and historical periods. Through studying different artistic and musical styles, students can learn about the history and traditions of different cultures and how they have influenced the world we live in today. This can broaden their perspectives and help them become more empathetic and understanding of others.

132.txt,"Success is a subjective concept that can be defined in a variety of ways. While some people may define success as earning a lot of money, others may define it in terms of personal fulfillment, relationships, or making a positive impact on the world. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that only people who earn a lot of money are successful.
One reason why this statement is not true is that success is not necessarily tied to financial wealth. Many people find success in their personal lives through meaningful relationships, good health, and a sense of purpose and fulfillment. For example, a person who has a strong network of supportive friends and family, is physically and mentally healthy, and is passionate about their hobbies and interests may consider themselves successful, even if they do not earn a high income.
Furthermore, success is often measured by one's impact on the world, not just by their financial wealth. Many people who make a significant contribution to society, such as scientists, educators, and activists, may not earn a high income but are still considered successful because of the positive impact they have had on the world.
In addition, the idea that only people who earn a lot of money are successful ignores the many other factors that contribute to an individual's financial success. Hard work, education, and opportunity all play a role in an individual's ability to earn a high income. It is not fair to say that someone who has not had the same opportunities or access to education as someone else is any less successful simply because they do not earn as much money.
In conclusion, the statement that only people who earn a lot of money are successful is not accurate.

126.txt,"It is a widely debated topic whether it is more important for students to study history and literature or science and mathematics. While both subjects have their own unique merits and benefits, I personally believe that it is more important for students to study science and mathematics.
One reason for this belief is that science and mathematics have a more practical and applicable value in everyday life. From basic concepts such as measurements and calculations, to more advanced topics such as physics and engineering, knowledge of science and mathematics allows individuals to better understand and navigate the world around them. For example, understanding basic principles of physics can help individuals understand how machines and technologies work, while knowledge of mathematics can help with financial planning and decision-making.
Furthermore, science and mathematics are crucial for many careers and fields of study. Many jobs, such as those in the fields of engineering, medicine, and computer science, require a strong foundation in science and mathematics. Additionally, these subjects are often prerequisites for further education in these fields. In contrast, while knowledge of history and literature can be interesting and enriching, it may not always have as much practical value or be as necessary for certain careers.
Additionally, science and mathematics promote critical thinking and problem-solving skills. These subjects require students to analyze and evaluate data, make logical conclusions, and apply their knowledge to solve problems. These skills are not only useful in science and mathematics, but also in a variety of other subjects and in everyday life.
However, this is not to say that history and literature are not important subjects. On the contrary, knowledge of history can provide valuable context and perspective on current events and help individuals understand different cultures and societies. Similarly, literature allows individuals to gain insight into human emotions and experiences, promoting empathy and understanding.

27.txt,"The potential construction of a new movie theater in my neighborhood is a controversial issue that has generated a lot of discussion and debate. On one hand, there are those who support the plan and see it as a positive addition to the community. On the other hand, there are those who oppose the plan, citing various reasons for their opposition.
One reason why some people may support the construction of a new movie theater is the convenience it would provide. Going to the movies can be a fun and enjoyable way to spend an evening, but it can also be time-consuming and inconvenient if the nearest theater is located far from one's home. Having a movie theater within easy reach would make it easier for people to access this form of entertainment, which could be especially appealing for families with young children or for those who do not have access to a car.
Another reason why some people may support the construction of a new movie theater is the economic benefits it could bring. A movie theater can be a major source of revenue for a community, as it generates income from ticket sales, concessions, and other related activities. This revenue can then be used to fund local projects and initiatives, such as improvements to parks, schools, and other public facilities. In addition, a movie theater can also create jobs, both directly through employment at the theater itself and indirectly through related businesses that may open up as a result of increased foot traffic in the area.
However, there are also valid reasons why some people may oppose the construction of a new movie theater. One concern is the potential impact on traffic and parking. A movie theater can attract large crowds, which can lead to increased traffic on local roads and a shortage of parking spaces. This can be especially problematic in neighborhoods that are already congested or have limited parking options.
Another concern is the potential impact on local businesses. While a movie theater can bring economic benefits to a community, it can also pose a threat to existing businesses. For example, a movie theater that is open late at night may compete with nearby restaurants and other nightlife establishments for customers. Similarly, a movie theater that sells concessions such as popcorn and soda may also compete with local snack shops and cafes.
In conclusion, the construction of a new movie theater in my neighborhood is a complex issue with both potential benefits and drawbacks. While the convenience and economic benefits of a new theater are appealing, the impact on traffic and parking and the potential competition with local businesses are valid concerns that need to be carefully considered. Ultimately, the decision to build a new movie theater should be based on a thorough analysis of all the pros and cons, and the needs and concerns of the community as a whole.",0.0,1.0,AI

Other people may learn best by reading about things, also known as visual learning. These individuals may prefer to absorb information through written materials such as textbooks or articles. Still, others may learn best by listening to people talk about things, also known as auditory learning. These individuals may prefer lectures, podcasts, or discussions with others in order to comprehend new information.
In my personal experience, I have found that I learn best by doing things and through visual learning. I have always been a hands-on learner and have found that I retain information better when I am able to apply it in a practical setting. For example, when I was in college and studying engineering, I found that I learned the most during lab sessions where I was able to build and test different prototypes. I also enjoyed reading the textbook and taking notes, as this allowed me to process the information in a structured way and refer back to it as needed.
On the other hand, I have found that auditory learning is not as effective for me as it can be difficult for me to fully concentrate and absorb the information when it is being presented through speech alone. I tend to need visual aids or written materials in order to fully grasp new concepts.
In conclusion, everyone learns in different ways and it is important to recognize what learning style works best for you in order to effectively absorb and retain new information. For me, hands-on experiences and visual learning are the most effective methods of learning, but it is important to consider and experiment with different methods to find what works best for you.",0.0,1.0,AI
130.txt,"As a resident of [your country], I believe that the development of a new research center in agriculture would be the most beneficial for our country.
There are several reasons why a research center focused on agriculture would be more beneficial for [your country] than one focused on business.
First, agriculture is a vital industry for many countries, including [your country]. It plays a crucial role in our economy and is a major source of employment for many of our citizens. Developing a research center that focuses on improving agricultural practices and technologies would not only benefit the agriculture industry, but it would also have a ripple effect on the economy as a whole.
Second, a research center focused on agriculture would have the opportunity to address some of the pressing issues facing the industry in [your country]. For example, our country may be facing challenges such as drought, pests, or soil degradation, and a research center focused on agriculture could work on finding solutions to these problems. This would not only benefit the agriculture industry, but it would also have a positive impact on the environment and the well-being of our citizens.
Finally, a research center focused on agriculture would align with the values and priorities of our country. [Your country] has a strong tradition of valuing the land and our agricultural heritage, and a research center focused on agriculture would be a way to honor and build upon this tradition.
In conclusion, I recommend that the university develop a new research center focused on agriculture for [your country]. This decision would benefit the agriculture industry, address pressing issues facing the industry, and align with the values and priorities of our country.",0.0,1.0,AI
124.txt,"It is true that people are often never satisfied with what they have and always want something more or something different. There are several reasons why this is the case.
Firstly, people are constantly bombarded with advertising and media messages that tell them they need to have the latest and greatest products in order to be happy or successful. These messages create a desire in people to upgrade their possessions and constantly strive for more.
Secondly, people have a natural tendency to compare themselves to others, and this can lead to a feeling of inadequacy or a desire to have what others have. This is especially true in today's society, where social media and other platforms make it easy for people to see what others are doing and what they have.
Thirdly, people's goals and desires tend to change over time, and as they achieve one thing, they often set their sights on the next goal. This can create a sense of never being satisfied, as people are always striving for something more or different.
In conclusion, it is true that people are never satisfied with what they have and always want something more or something different. This is due to a variety of factors, including advertising and media messages, comparison to others, and a natural desire to achieve new goals.

125.txt,"As a language model, I am programmed to provide information and generate responses, but I do not have personal beliefs or opinions. However, I can certainly present arguments for and against the statement ""People should read only those books that are about real events, real people, and established facts.""
One argument in favor of this statement is that reading about real events, real people, and established facts can be educational and informative. Books that are based on true events can provide insight into historical or current events and give a deeper understanding of the world around us. Similarly, biographies and non-fiction works can offer a glimpse into the lives and experiences of real people and can be inspiring or thought-provoking. Reading books that are based on established facts can also help us learn new things and expand our knowledge base.
On the other hand, there are also valid arguments against this statement. Fiction, for example, can be just as educational and informative as non-fiction. Many fictional works are based on real events or are inspired by real people, but they often take creative liberties in order to tell a compelling story. Additionally, fiction can be a powerful tool for exploring and examining complex ideas, emotions, and social issues in a way that is not always possible with non-fiction. Fiction can also serve as a means of escapism and entertainment, which can be important for mental health and well-being.
In conclusion, whether or not people should read only books that are about real events, real people, and established facts is a matter of personal preference and depends on an individual's goals and interests. While there are certainly benefits to reading non-fiction and books based on real events, there are also many benefits to reading fiction and other imaginative works. Ultimately, the important thing is that people have the opportunity to read a diverse range of books and have the freedom to choose what they read.",0.0,1.0,AI
131.txt,"There is no denying that many young children spend a great amount of their time practicing sports. Some parents encourage their children to practice sports for various reasons, such as improving physical health, developing social skills, and building character. However, there are also some drawbacks to this.
One of the main advantages of practicing sports at a young age is that it can improve physical health. Children who are involved in sports tend to be more physically active, which can help them maintain a healthy weight, build strong bones and muscles, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease. Furthermore, practicing sports can also improve coordination, balance, and flexibility, which can benefit children in their everyday activities.
Another advantage of practicing sports at a young age is that it can help children develop social skills. Sports can provide children with an opportunity to interact with their peers, learn teamwork, and develop leadership skills. In addition, children who are involved in sports often have a sense of belonging to a team or club, which can boost their self-esteem and confidence.
A third advantage of practicing sports at a young age is that it can help children build character. Children who practice sports are often taught the values of discipline, perseverance, and sportsmanship, which can help them develop a strong work ethic and a positive attitude. These values can also translate to other areas of their lives, such as school and relationships.
However, there are also some disadvantages to practicing sports at a young age. One of the main drawbacks is that it can be time-consuming and require a significant commitment. Children who practice sports may have less time to spend with their families or pursue other interests, such as music or art. In addition, practicing sports can be physically and mentally demanding, which can lead to burnout or injuries. Children who are injured may also experience emotional distress and may need to take a break from sports to recover.
In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to practicing sports at a young age. While sports can improve physical health, develop social skills, and build character, they can also be time-consuming and physically demanding. It is important for parents to consider these factors when deciding whether to encourage their children to practice sports and to ensure that their children are participating in sports in a healthy and balanced way.",0.0,1.0,AI

By interacting with people who have different backgrounds and experiences, you can expand your understanding of the world and gain new insights. This can also help you develop a more open-minded and inclusive attitude towards others.
Another advantage of having friends who are different from you is the opportunity to challenge your own beliefs and assumptions. When you are surrounded by people who think and act in similar ways, it can be easy to become entrenched in your own viewpoints. However, when you have friends who have different viewpoints and ways of doing things, it can encourage you to question and reflect on your own beliefs, leading to personal growth and development.
On the other hand, having friends who are similar to you can also bring advantages. One benefit is the feeling of shared understanding and connection. When you have friends who have similar interests, values, and experiences, it can be easier to relate to each other and feel a sense of belonging. This can provide a sense of comfort and support, especially in times of need.
Another advantage of having friends who are similar to you is the ease of communication and shared activities. When you have friends who are similar to you, you may have similar goals and hobbies, which can make it easier to plan and enjoy activities together. This can also lead to a greater sense of mutual support and teamwork.
Personally, I prefer to have a mix of friends who are different from me and friends who are similar to me.

18.txt,"There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of whether it is better to learn by oneself or with a teacher. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best method for any given individual will depend on a variety of factors, including their learning style, goals, and resources.
On the one hand, learning by oneself can be very rewarding and empowering. It allows the learner to set their own pace, focus on their specific areas of interest, and take control of their own education. It can also be more convenient, as it allows the learner to study at their own convenience and doesn't require them to coordinate with a teacher or class schedule.
However, learning by oneself can also be more challenging and time-consuming. Without the guidance and support of a teacher, it can be difficult for the learner to stay motivated and on track, and they may struggle to find resources and materials that are tailored to their needs. Additionally, learning by oneself may not provide the same opportunities for feedback, guidance, and personalized instruction that a teacher can offer.
On the other hand, learning with a teacher can be a more structured and supported approach to learning. A teacher can provide clear goals and expectations, offer feedback and guidance, and help the learner stay motivated and on track. They can also provide resources and materials that are tailored to the learner's needs, and can offer personalized instruction to help the learner understand difficult concepts.
However, learning with a teacher can also have its challenges. It may require more time and effort to coordinate with a teacher or class schedule, and the learner may not have as much control over their own learning experience. Additionally, not all teachers are equally effective, and the learner may not always find the teaching style or approach of their teacher to be a good fit for their needs.
In conclusion, both learning by oneself and learning with a teacher have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will depend on the individual learner's goals, learning style, and resources. Some people may find that they prefer one approach over the other, while others may benefit from a combination of both methods. Ultimately, the most important thing is to find a learning approach that works best for you and helps you achieve your goals.",0.0,1.0,AI
24.txt,"In some countries, it is common for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students. There are both pros and cons to this arrangement, and ultimately it depends on the individual circumstances of the teenager and their ability to balance work and school commitments.
One potential benefit of having a job while in school is that it can provide teenagers with valuable work experience and skills. This can help them to develop a strong resume and stand out to future employers, as well as giving them a sense of responsibility and independence. Working while in school can also be a good source of income for teenagers, allowing them to pay for their own expenses or save up for the future.
However, there are also potential drawbacks to working while in school. Depending on the number of hours worked and the demands of the job, it can be difficult for teenagers to balance their schoolwork and their job responsibilities. This can lead to reduced academic performance, as well as increased stress and fatigue. Additionally, if a teenager is working a significant number of hours, they may have less time for extracurricular activities, socializing, and other important aspects of their personal development.
Overall, whether it is a good idea for teenagers to have jobs while they are still students depends on the individual circumstances of each teenager and their ability to manage their time and responsibilities effectively.

15.txt,"Optional attendance to classes at universities has been an increasingly popular way for students to study for several years in quite a few countries. However, it has not yet had its intended results as it had been hoped. In fact, today, this system seems to be one of the reasons for the corruption of university education. In my opinion, compulsory attendance is better than having no requirement to attend all the lessons on-campus.
There are two points of view to this question. First, one side will say that university students are adults and should be able to manage their time as they see fit. This point of view says that sometimes, in today’s busy world, people need flexibility to manage their lives. For example, many single parents who are trying to earn their college degrees will sometimes need to skip a class because of the demands of their other responsibilities. However, I believe that the great majority of college students are young and single, and have few responsibilities, and that they need the discipline and structure of a system that requires attendance. Young people who have just gone off to college are notorious for the excesses to which they enjoy their freedom.
There are many negative situations caused by the free-attendance system. The most harmful one is the economic waste for both universities and students. Many students who do not attend classes regularly are likely to suffer decreased performance on their exams and therefore waste their time in college. They, generally, do not feel panic because of the failures or restudying the same subjects for the second time. However, this sometimes costs a fortune to both parents and the government that have created tax-funded subsidies for education for each student every year. Not only are the university fees wasted, but also the money for accommodations and other spending are also wasted.
On the other hand, students who are required to attend classes regularly have no time to waste in pubs or clubs. Nor can they spend these young years, which are more valuable to them to learn and think than any other period in their lives, on gambling or drinking. I do not mean they are only to study without any break or entertainment. Their social life is as necessary as studying during the hard academic years; yet, the amount of each should be balanced well. More spare time than necessary encourages the young to ignore studying and classes. Thus, neither the universities nor the students do their best if the students have too much freedom not to study.
To sum up, many teenagers are not able to think sensibly to decide when to study and when to enjoy with friends. A scheduled chart of classes, which have a huge number of options that are necessary to identify the best fitting one for each student, will help them to construct an ideal campus life including leisure activities. In addition, this will stop the waste of time and money and is likely to reevaluate the higher education system in several years. In short, I believe that the majority of college students are too young to manage their time responsibly and that universities should therefore impose strict rules on attendance.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN
114.txt,"Some people think that children should begin their education as early in their lives as possible, while others think that children should spend most of their time playing. Each opinion could be supported by a number of arguments. However, it is my opinion that playing is more important activity than learning for children during their early years.
It could be argued that it's important that some basic logical and verbal skills be learnt as early as possible. The argument goes on to assert that the children much more easily accept skills like basic calculus and foreign languages when they are very young. Moreover, if children start their education early, they can have more time to perfect their knowledge later during their lives. This way they can become better professionals. Finally, when children are at school, they parents don't have to look after them. Instead, they can work and earn more money for themselves, as well as their children.
In contrast to these opinions, there are others who claim that children should at least have their childhood, since their whole life will be most probably filled with work and study. Furthermore, physical skills, which are developed by playing, are just as important as intellectual ones. When children are not forced to go to school at an early age, they can spend more time with their parents. In fact, it is often claimed that don't need teachers other than parents, since parents know them best and are most committed to teaching them.
My opinion is that young children should spend most of their time playing. It seems to me that it's not natural for children to start formal education earlier than age 6, for instance. All the teaching they need can be provided informally, by parents. On the other hand, early physical development can't be compensated later, and it would suffer greatly if children were not allowed to spend enough time playing.
As we can see, young than by older children more easily process certain types of information, which is why some people claim that this advantage should be exploited by making children study while they are still very young. However, I disagree with this approach, since I think that children should be above all allowed to spend their early childhood the way they like best, and that is playing and having fun with their friends.",0.9965,0.0035,HUMAN

The product that I select should be native to my own nation so that I can inform my nation's excellence to the people of the world. In this essay, I will describe the attire that I will offer in great detail.
In my native country, there is a traditional garment called ""Hanbok"". Its vivid color and intricate, ingenious design will evoke people's applause.
The reason that I would choose ""Hanbok"" is that its pattern is unique and innovative. The main difference between ""Hanbok"" and regular western dress is that the former is extremely practical, while the latter is not. It is suitable for any kinds of meetings, so you don't have to squander you money in purchasing luxurious dresses.
Due to its extraordinary design, ""Hanbok"" can adapt to any kind of circumstances. In the summer, ""Hanbok"" will lower your body temperature, because it is full of minute holes. In the winter, ""Hanbok"" will maintain your body temperature, so that you wouldn't have to worry about getting cold.
""Hanbok"" consists of several picturesque (charming) colors; green, red, yellow, and blue. The colors symbolize my nation's patience and creativity. Hence, presenting ""Hanbok"" in an international fair will result in my country's success.

Nonetheless, youth are the product of its upbringing and the representation of its time. Thus, what they are and what they know will certainly be different from those of the older generation. Therefore, to say that the youngsters are useless is not only wrong as they can also contribute in their own way and teach the older generation a lesson or two.
As we all know, today's technology moves very fast. With our daily responsibility, it is almost impossible for us to keep up with every little new gadget that comes out everyday. With young people, its different, new things interest them. Furthermore, being young they absorb new knowledge like a sponge. Thus, they can help us in getting in tune with new technologies. Young kids, for example, can probably teach their grandparents to use the computers, which in turn, will also be good for their relationships.
In addition to that, by looking at the young, we can learn about the society better. As I've mentioned earlier, youngsters represent their time, hence, by understanding them, we can understand the needs of the society, as this group of age is the most outspoken. A good example would be the hippie movement in the 60s. The movement displayed their dissatisfaction with the system and the need for more freedom of expression.
As someone once said, ""Life is a learning experience"", thus, from that, we can deduce that there is no full stop to the process of learning.

For example, I can bring my favorite book in the train to read during commuting or traveling. Also, it is a good idea to read novels to kill my time when taking a boring lecture. I can soon go into the world in the book and enjoy seeking what happens next with a lot of imagination alone. People often say that reading books develop children's creativity and I agree that. However, I enjoy watching movies more than reading something for the following reasons.
First of all, it is easy to have a fun with movies. Even if we don't watch a movie from the start, we will know soon what is going on in the story. Screens where characters act through a camera make audience pay attention easily because of the visual scenes and sound. The mixture of clear, beautiful or horrible pictures and its matched sounds have great effect on audience so that they will not forget the scenes.
Second, if you like a character in a movie, you can be excited in not only the flow of the story but also keeping watching the person. Moreover, I would like to get items characters in films use and imitate their fashions; we can get a lot of hints and ideas, which make our daily lives more comfortable and enjoyable.
Watching one movie with friends is also a happy time. After watching it, we will chat about the stories, characters and what each of us felt. We talk and listen to them and give our own judgment. We can do such a thing because we can watch movies with more that two people at the same time, on the other hand, reading books tend to enjoy alone.

101.txt,"For the last five years of my life, I have been living with roommates - a long enough time for me to know the kinds of people I prefer to live with, and the kinds that don’t want to be around. Which is why, when I was told that I needed to share a room with another girl, I decided to do the choosing myself.
This would not be such an easy choice to make, but at least I had a few points on my side. First of all, I had lived in this one town all my life, and I had so many friends going to university at the same time as myself, so it would be no problem finding someone willing to share with me. Also, I figured that if I let the authorities chose someone for me to live with, then they probably would chose someone that I had never known before, and because it is so hard for me to make friends, I would take a very long time to get used to this new person.
With this in mind I decided that letting the school chose someone for me is not a good idea. Also, it would be so much better if I chose someone for myself because I have a lot of rules that govern my life and I expect whoever I live with to follow them. I sleep very early at night, something that many young people I know don't do. There is no guarantee that the person the school chooses for me is going to sleep as early as I do, therefore the most logical option is for me to find someone that can fit my needs. Also I am a vegetarian, and the slightest smell of meat anywhere around the house can make me get very sick, so I need to be sure that the person I live with either is a vegetarian like myself or is going to remember never to bring meat around me. The most important factor in me wanting to choose a roommate of my own is the fact that I love animals. Wherever I have lived, I have always had at least three cats living with me. I love animals so much and I possibly cannot live without them. Not everyone however shares this same passion that I do, infect, many young people do not have time to care for pets, and don't especially like them, or worst, are allergic to them. For this reason I need to find someone that shares this passion with me, or at least doesn't mind having pets around the house. If the school was to choose someone with whom I was so live, then for all I know, it could be someone who cannot stand the sight of pets.
One last reason I would want to choose a roommate for myself is the fact that I have a best friend with whom I have been sharing flats for five years. Now, both of us are accepted into this university, and I would love to continue being with her. We both get along very well, and I don't need to put in extra effort to start a good relationship all over again.
For these reasons, it is clear to me that I would never want the school authorities to find a flat mate for me when I can find one for myself - especially one that will completely suit me.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN

Building a new university can offer a lot of opportunities to everybody. First, it will provide an excellent alternative to the existing university, which, unfortunately, cannot accommodate the growing numbers of students each year. Secondly, this will stop monopoly of education resulting to stagnation of the quality of education by creating a healthy competition to other institution to maintain and improve their standards of education.
Moreover, students can now have the options to choose which university they prefer and take courses, which they really like.
A new university also means more job opportunities especially for teachers, administrative staff and others who are in need of employment.
However, a new university can also create problems to the community, more universities in the community do not immediately mean better education. Sometimes, the quality of education suffers from quantity because school administrators tend to commercialize education to attract more students. The policies may become lax; the rules may bend to accommodate the whims of students in order to keep them.
A new university would also lead to an increase of migration of people who would like to avail higher education. This can lead to increased pollution and even crimes. The once peaceful community may become noisy and chaotic because of the increased number of people with different personalities.

Being a working person, with all day long office work and driving long way, it becomes difficult to do all preparation for making food. For me easy way to get food is restaurant, where I can get prepared food at home or office by just ordering on phone, Along with that another comfort is, that when ever I have to eat together with my so many friends, I can always go to a restaurant, otherwise it’s difficult to prepare food at home for so many people and don’t get time to talk and having fun. So I always find it a easier way to eat out, apart from that It make my other outdoor activities possible because I don’t have to bother about food wherever I go, to any fun place or theater or traveling, restaurants are always there throughout city and it becomes easy every time to get food whenever and whenever I need according to other activities.
Besides that I can save a lot of time by getting food from restaurant as, I don’t have to go for vegetables and grocery shopping, I don’t need to clean, cut and fry food and do a lot kitchen work, doing dishes etc., instead I can get fresh food delivered in minutes. Along with that when I eat at restaurant I have more time to do other things like reading, watching TV, and listening music, going out theatre, or having fun with friends, that don’t make me tired or boring and I feel refreshed for next day work, so by going to restaurant I can manage a lot more activities instead preparing food.

28.txt,"I do agree with the statement that people should sometimes do things that they don't enjoy doing. And I would rather go as far as saying that they should try to enjoy things they are forced to do.
To exemplify, consider the following situations. Not all children love to study. Instead, being curious and enthusiastic, they love to explore the world around them, paying less attention to studies and more to other things. Should they be allowed to give up their studies? Certainly not. Or consider a very talented person, say a person with great academic record and excellent analytical skills trying for a job. Suppose the person is introvert but the company's recruitment process demands that he should go in through a group discussion. Should he give up because of this? I would strongly oppose his decision, if he does. Or consider a sportsperson being forced to go in for a drug test, because rules demand him to do so. The person being from a conservative background feels uncomfortable with this. Should he give up the sport just because he is being forced to do something he doesn't like? Well, I would say no.
So, the point is that there are situations in life, when one has to do something he/she doesn't like. And not doing the thing may have a large impact on his life. So, it’s sometimes wise to go against one's wishes. I don't advocate that one should always go against one's wishes when he/she is forced to take such decisions. It depends upon the importance and the urgency of a situation. For instance, one might want to quit up a job that one doesn't like. He may, infect he should do so, for perpetually doing something one doesn't like makes one's life miserable. But what if there's a recession in the economy and its hard to find jobs? He, of course should be careful in his decision, and it won't be unwise if he continues with his same, probably boring job.
To conclude, I would say that one should judge a situation according to its merits and make a wise decision whether or not he/she wants to do something, which he/she doesn't like. Compromising once in a while is sometimes a better choice.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN
16.txt,"Neighbors are part of our daily lives. They are part of the process of socialization. Socialization is the process in which we interact with other people. In our lives we are always trying to look for a good area to live, a nice house, and most important of all good neighbors. This will influence in the decision of either moving to the area, or star looking for another area. In my opinion a good neighbor will be those who are respectful, friendly, and helpful.
The first quality that good neighbors should have is to be respectful. Respect is the most important aspect of being good neighbor. Neighbors should respect your space and privacy in order to live in a peaceful environment. Being a respectful neighbor means not invading your personal space as well as your property. Another example will be to maintain a quiet environment not allowing loud music, or noise that will bother others. Respect to one another is the most important quality that a neighbor should have in order to live in harmony.
Another quality of a good neighbor is that it should be friendly. All people should be friendly to one another, but this quality is most important when it comes to neighbors. Neighbors are close to you, to your home, property and most important to your family. You might not see them every day, but they live next to you all the time. These are the reasons why they should be friendly. One of the ways to be friendly is by showing they care about you, and they should welcome you to their neighborhood. Friendly neighbors make a good and united society.
The last quality of good neighbor is that it should be helpful. Neighbors as well as everyone should be helpful to one another. Helpfulness is a characteristic that everyone should have. A helpful neighbor is that, that in the times of need is there for you. For example, if a person is in a situation where he/she needs a moral support for the lost a loving family member, the neighbor should give this person all the support he/she might need and encourage he/she that they can count on them no matter what.

Personally, I prefer the latter because I find that working with one's hands will reap a greater sense of satisfaction when the task has been completed. Consider a case. Your friend's birthday is coming up. It would be absolutely fabulous if you could send her a gift personally, right up her doorstep instead of sending her an electronic greeting card with the computer in your bedroom. Doing things with your own hands brings allows us to appreciate the fruits of labor and hard work.
The virtual world is far too distant and unrealistic. Human touch is still the most sincere way to make friends and communicate with your loved ones. Moreover, an over reliance on machines will tend to make us less capable in completing simple task. Taking a short ten minute walk to the shop opposite your house to buy some daily necessities will benefit our health because it allows us to exercise our limbs after lying on a couch in front of the television for over two hours but majority of the people nowadays will choose to drive there instead, claiming that it saves time and strength. Human's natural ability to move and do work has depleted over the years with the invention of machines which enable us not to even move ourselves to get things done. It would benefit and foster family relationships by doing things together such as cleaning the house or clearing the garden with your siblings instead of ordering the maid-""a human machine"" around or following a schedule to take turns to clean up the mess using a vacuum cleaner in less than half an hour.

117.txt,"Everyday, as soon as we wake up, we are already busy planning all our activities for the day. As we go to bed, we continue to think and plan our activities for the following day. This routine continues day in and day out. That is why; some people prefer to plan their activities for their free time carefully out of habit or as an extension of what they used to do. However, for some people, free time means a time to relax and not make any pans at all, which I also prefer.
Nowadays, time seems to fly and no matter how fast we do things, we can’t seem to have enough. Having free time becomes a luxury, and people intend to enjoy every second of it. Planning their activities carefully assures them they would not miss anything and no time will be wasted on unnecessary or trivial matters.
One good example is going for a long drive to another place. Planning which place to go through either on the Internet or through brochure gives them a foresight of what to expect and do. Placing reservation on their intended hotel or resort assures them of immediate accommodation regardless of what time they arrive. Checking the condition of the car results to uninterrupted traveling and breakdown-free. Preparing a checklist and packing things the night before prevents situation of leaving out important things. In short, being prepared, leaves for very little possibility of problems and assures them of a worry-free leisure time.
However, as we wake up and go to bed, we always worry on things that we are supposed to do and accomplish. We hardly have time for ourselves. That is why, during free time, some people prefer not to make any plans. They would like to spend it to relax, forget about everything and enjoy the beauty of letting life and time pass them. Letting their mind relax and getting rid of all their worries, it allows them to appreciate things they do not normally see or value: spending time with their loved ones, doing nothing, seeing their children play with themselves, watching TV, appreciating the beauty of flowers blooming, watching the birds soar high, exchanging pleasantries with their neighbors, playing with their dogs, and being thankful for all their blessings. These things do not need planning at all, but these simple activities are the ones that give most people their greatest pleasure.
In summary, some people prefer to plan their activities carefully for their free time because they want to make the most out of it. Others prefer not to plan anything at all because free time is the time to reflect and enjoy life as it is, I could not agree more.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN

In the early age of person, there is more influence by family. But as soon as becoming the younger, they come more contact to friends rather then family. Younger people like the company of their age with whom they can share their ideas, thoughts, life etc. With some good friends, one can develop itself taking examples from the good friends. Friends can exchange their good thoughts, developing careers, and some good and bad things with friends also. Some talks are like that one cannot share it with family but can share with friends.
Secondly, friends play an important role in our lives. They are the most important people who can change one's path by giving them right decision or right advice or may spoil the life by giving the wrong advice. Its all depends on type and nature of friends. If we have good friends, who can understand and knowledgeable person, they are always helpful to us. In the contrary, if friends are not good, then in their friendship, one can spoil his/her life also. I would like to give example here, how friends can more influence on young adults.

With the enhancement of human knowledge on electronics and machine based processing, computing and storage systems, human lives have been radically changed. Not only has the spheres of education and science and technology advanced as a result of its own offspring, the computer era, but also the whole world and its myriad problems have been solved by the computers, which man, its creator was unable to.
That computers have had an enormously positive impact on the lives of people, from the poorest of the poor to the richie-richs is a fact beyond contestation. While on one hand, when the computer revolution, especially the mainframes has given a new Life to the space age and mankind has thus been able to explore space to such an extent that space is no longer a mystery to us. On the other hand, the need based and intelligible use of computers has solved the greatest problems in the industry and agriculture as well. The tremendously useful and efficient control system instrumentation in industry has made productivity of plants rise in leaps and bounds. It has aided us to even such a great extent that the world economy has an new frontier called the IT or Knowledge sector based on the Computer system and its handling by humans. A government of any sovereign represents the people. Quoting Abraham Lincoln's famous
Words for a democratic government ""is for the people, by the people and of the people”. Thus the primary job of any government, whether elected or not is to look after its people and hope for the collective betterment of its masses. The development of an economy is only a medium of fulfilling its basic duty of empowering and satisfying people's basic needs. Hence the reigns of economy in the hands of government are to be so directed as to suit and benefit its people the most. Addressing and fulfilling the basic needs, wants and desires of the people to as much level as possible are thus the foremost responsibility and a mandatory requirement for any government.
The immense aid to mankind that the computers have done so far has been a real good pointer as to whether it can be integrated to anything and everything of our lives. And, thus several scientists worldwide have been working on myriad platforms for developing several things to benefit mankind.
But, still, computers cannot feed the poor, can't cover his/her body or provide him a space to live in. This being the most basic needs which any government has to fulfill. Though in all these processes computer technology can well be implemented to best uses as a medium of improving the time and cost requirements at least. Thus it can be definitely seen that the computer technology at the current stage of development by itself can never achieve theses basic goals. A strong infrastructure is what facilitates to solve such basic problems.
So in my view, for the countries of developed world and some of the world’s developing economies it is but natural to invest hugely in computer technology for providing its people with a better and more prosperous future. But for the others, i.e. the underdeveloped countries and the one's in which most people still live below the poverty line it is important to think and allocate resources in such a fashion that the basic infrastructure for the people is developed and also the needs to march with times is served.",0.9997,0.0003,HUMAN

Since my neghborhood is pretty far from the city's center I have to drive several hours until I find a good restaurant. The result is that I, as well as the other members of the neighborhood, go only to restaurants only in special occasions (for instance, in birthdates). When the restaurant will be built I will have the opportunity to go to restaurants more often, the way other people from other neighborhoods do.
In addition, the restaurant may offer work for the students who live in our neighborhood. If the restaurant will be successful, it will naturally need a lot of waiters. The students in my neighborhood, who need to work in a working place that allows flexible working hours, would love finding a job where they can earn some money. Therefore, if the restaurant will hire them as waiters, it might help them a lot. I can take myself as a good example: when I was a student I lived in another neighborhood where two restaurants were located. I used to work as a waiter in one of these restaurants, earning money for the university's tuition fees.
In conclusion, I strongly support building the new restaurants in our neighborhood. The restaurant will allow me (as well as to the other neighbors) to eat in a restaurant more often. The new restaurant might also offer job opportunities to the students of the neighborhood.",0.9972,0.0028,HUMAN
106.txt,"It is a commonly accepted fact that society benefits from the work of its members. Some of them are more inclined to artistic forms of creation, while others prefer working in a scientific framework. Both scientists and artists contribute to the society in their own way. Works of artists affect people's state of mind, and works of scientists affect their everyday life. In my opinion, scientific work is more valued by the modern society.
Artists make art, and art makes people feel better. Artistic creations may be more or less valuable, from the connoisseur's point of view, but nevertheless, some people find them enjoyable and pleasing. For instance, looking at a beautiful picture or listening to Beethoven's symphony seems very relaxing after a hard day spent in the office. Furthermore, museums and galleries all over the world are made possible by the work of the generations of artists, from the ancient times until today. Without the museums and galleries, men of modern age would not be able to improve their knowledge about past times. Therefore, education is also the important role of artists. The art enriches people's spirits and makes them more imaginative; while at the same time teaches them about historical events.
Scientists contribute to the society in a different way. Their influence is of more material, and less spiritual nature. For example, physicists try to determine the laws of nature and engineers then use that knowledge in order to make various devices and systems. Those products of joint efforts of physics and engineering make ordinary people's lives easier. Just think about the difference that was made by the invention of microwave ovens for example.
It is my opinion that science is more appreciated than art by the modern society. There are several reasons that lead to this conclusion. People find it easier to accept information in material, than in spiritual form. For example, using typical products of science, such as computers or TVs, doesn't require much mental effort, while art can sometimes be obscure and hard to grasp. Furthermore, in many countries, science receives generous financial support from the government, while art seldom does. This is because a country's military and economic power is dominantly affected by its science, not art. Therefore, scientists are played much better than artists. In fact, having art as a sole profession is very unlikely to provide enough money to support a family, for instance. Even though some people become fascinated with art classes while in school, later in life they are usually forced to move towards more scientific fields of work, such as economics or engineering.
In conclusion, scientists and artists both have their ways of contributing to the society. Artists affect people's lives in the spiritual sense, by forming their life views, educating them, or simply by relaxing them when they are tired and exhausted. On the other hand, science affects material side of life, by creating inventions that relieve people of hard work, thus making them have more free time. Science is more appreciated than art in modern society, because science is more precise and easier to understand, while art can be abstruse. Also, science is more important for the country's economy and army, which makes it more interesting for the government.",0.9965,0.0035,HUMAN
112.txt,"Due to our society's rapid progress, a human being has been able to survive without communicating with other people. In the last few decades, various machines have been invented and spreader throughout the world. This sudden technological advance is the main perpetrator that made human beings extremely egoistic. Personally, I prefer to spend most of my time with my amicable, warm-hearted companions. In this essay, I will explain my opinion by offering several reasons.
My mom has always told me that intimate relationships with people are really important in one's life. A human being, in order to live a life without any regrets, needs another person to depend upon. It is a well-known maxim that every man has shortcomings. Through close friendships, a mortal experiences a variety of activities, and realizes one's shortcomings. At the same time, the person can make one's friend be aware of his/her faults. This mutual relationship will eventually result in mental development of two human beings.
An amiable relationship is not only beneficial for the realization of each other's shortcomings but also for their happiness. My friends and I often play soccer or basketball when we meet. These activities that we do together will be cherished as good lifetime's memory. Thus, a pleasant comradeship can be the main producer of pure joy.
Therefore, a companionship is wholesome in a lot of ways. First, we can become more advanced human beings through our mutual relationship. Second, we can receive mirth through the things that we collaborate on.

113.txt,"There are some people who have a large group of friends while others prefer spending time only with a couple of their close friends. Both these attitudes have their advantages and disadvantages. I will analyze both cases and present my views in favor of having a few close friends.
When a person spends time with several people it helps him share his ideas with and collect information from various different sources. It broadens his horizons and makes him aware of different points of view on any subject. It also makes him socially more active and as is commonly said, ""Man is supposed to be a social animal"".
On the other hand being with a couple of close friends helps a people achieve a level of intimacy not possible in a large group. They develop a bond between them that is hard to break. Such people share an understanding, which leads to high levels of loyalty. It leads to a kind of friendship that can be depended on in any kind of situation. Such friends are truly loyal and would never shrink back from supporting each other.
I personally prefer spending time with my close friends, who happen to be just one or two. They are the friends I am absolutely comfortable with. In school I had just two good friends who I am very close to. I can share any thought of mine with them. Very often they understand my feelings without me having to state them explicitly. In college I have a large number of friends, and though I can discuss a variety of subjects with them, I do not share the level of intimacy with them that I share with my school friends.
Due to these reasons, I prefer having a couple of close friends. They are the friends I can always trust, those I can turn to whenever a situation becomes unmanageable.

107.txt,"Students are often able to choose whether they want to live in a dormitory, on a university campus, or in a separate apartment in the community. Each of these environments has its advantages. In this essay I will present some of the facts that support both solutions, and I will argue in favor of living in an apartment.
Living in dorm offers a chance to improve communication skills, to learn to live with other people. For example, roommates must adjust their eating and sleeping habits according to each other's needs. Each one must arrange his free time in such way that he doesn't bother others while they are studying. Moreover, the social structure of the dorm community is in many aspects similar to that of a typical office, or workplace in general. Both environments require finding solutions to various problems and cooperation of the people in order to achieve that. Thus, by adapting to conditions of living in the dormitory, students actually prepare themselves for their future jobs. The environment in the dorm is friendlier and understanding, because it is consisted of other students, who often have similar problems and interests. The social life is more interesting, too. For example, if students failed to understand a lecture as it was presented in class, he can ask his friends from the dorm for an explanation. Also, it’s much easier to find a common topic to chat about, or an interesting activity to practice in free time.
On the other hand, living in separate apartment usually means having less neighbors and roommates. In fact, it is not a rare case that a student has whole apartment for himself. In this situation, there is less distraction, so students can concentrate better on their schoolwork. As a consequence, their grades are better. Another advantage is that living alone means having more privacy. This aspect is very important, because everyone has personal secrets, which he wants to hide from all other people, even the closest friends. Finally, students who live in the apartments can maintain contacts with their neighbors, ordinary people, and are not confined to academic community. This way, students are offered a wider variety of experiences from everyday life, which they may find useful in their future lives.
If I were in a situation to choose whether I would live in the dormitory or have a separate apartment, I would choose to live in separate apartment. It could be argued that living separately narrows one's circle of close friends, precluding him from having regular contacts with other people. This argument goes on to assert that such students are deprived of social experiences, and therefore remain aloof and introvert. However, it is a fact that students can make enough friends even if they live outside of the university campus, especially if the apartment is shared between several students. Furthermore, friends can visit each other as often as they need to. They can maintain friendly contact in a way, which doesn't affect their school performance. Careful planning and wise distribution of time can achieve this. If a student assigns enough time for studying, his grades won't suffer, and he will still be able to spend the remaining time with his friends. Alternatively, students who live in a school dormitory are constantly surrounded with familiar people. They can't avoid excessive socializing, even if they want to. Therefore, they spend too little time studying and they get low grades.
In conclusion, living in the dormitory may be more interesting and socially challenging, but it's rather unsuitable for serious studying. Living in an apartment, however, allows a student to socialize, but only to the extent that doesn't affect his schoolwork negatively. This way, positive effects of living both in dormitory and in an apartment are obtained.",0.9997,0.0003,HUMAN
12.txt,"Some people claim that universities should give the same sum of money to their students' sports activities as to their university libraries. They point out that universities should attract more students to exercise, because a healthy body can make a student bear the heavy studies. On the other hand, most people, like me, strongly disagree with it. In the following paragraphs, I will explain some main reasons.
In the first place, an obvious advantage to spend more money on libraries is that enormous libraries can help us save a huge amount of money, paper resource and the time to seek study materials from a far bookstore. As we all known, the prices of books are more expensive than before, while we have to read more books to catch up with the high-tech era. Moreover, now many students are still too poor to go to school, therefore libraries become the cheapest places to provide useful knowledge for them. Just imagine these poor persons can enjoy varieties of books in a comfortable environment with enough light and a quiet study atmosphere. How happy they are!
Secondly, another reason why I disagree is that the chief goal of university education is to teach students working skills. Obviously, libraries provide more useful information to students than sports activities do. For example, more and more libraries are also equipped with computers, which can encourage students to surf the Net to widen their horizons. Without the Internet, there will be fewer chances to make friend with the foreigners and catch the latest worldwide information. On the contrary, sports activities are just limited in a small area and a few of friends in some degree.
However, I don not deny that sports activities can provide chances to develop some good characteristics, such as cooperation. But frankly speaking, it is a bit wasteful to spend too much money on sports activities, when we can attain enough free exercises, such as running, which gain the same advantages as well. Furthermore, students are easily obsessed by the activities and overlook their studies. For instant, I once used so much study time to play basketball that I failed to go up to the next grade. Although I earned some awards of basketball matches at that time, I feel very regret. In fact, numerous students have the similar stories because of the attraction of the sports activities.
In conclusion, I firmly disagree with the idea that universities should give the same sum of money to their students' sports activities as they give to their university libraries. Nevertheless we are sure that both universities libraries and proper sports activities are valuable. Anyway, to avoid students playing overtime and ignoring their homework should be concerned.

139.txt,"Rooms are one of the many important factors in a house. Architectures, when drawing the plan of a house consider these room-factors seriously. When we are buying a house, new or old, we place emphasis on the different types and number of rooms in the house, their conditions, seizes, general orientation and other factors of the very rooms like the windows, the height of the ceilings and so on. However, among the different types of rooms that can be found in today’s modern houses, I consider the most important to be the sitting room.
There is an adage or a saying that the sitting room is the marrow of the house. This is very right. For example if the sitting room is always dirty, one can always expect the whole house to be dirty too. So the living room shows the hygienic condition of the house.
Furthermore, the sitting room is very important because when we have visitors, we rarely invite them to our bedrooms or to the toilet or to the bathroom. No. We invite them to sit in the sitting room where we welcome them or discuss some issues. For sure, they look around to see how tidy is the room, how is it arranged and what we have in the house. That impression of the sitting room will always be with them about the whole house, about how we live and how tidy we are. In these regards, the sitting room serves as the face of the house, a sort of the public relations manager.
Apart from the above-mentioned reasons, the sitting room is much more important than the other rooms for the very purpose it is supposed to be: for sitting. Having a place to sit in the house is very important. For example, imagine coming from a very hard days job, very tired. Sure the first thing one does on getting to the house is to head for the sitting room, most probable get a cold drink from the refrigerator and relax by sitting down in the sitting room, put on the television and for a moment forget about the hard days job.
In conclusion, the sitting room is very important in the house for the purposes it serves, mainly, it portrays and gives impressions to others about how we live, how tidy we are, that is, it is the mirror and the public relation 'manager' of the house, and it is one of the best place where we can relax in the house.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN

105.txt,"Many people believe that one can be successful if he /she is committed, honest, faithful or intelligence. But, the foundation of each of these qualities lies in believing the power the person has, and working accordingly to achieve the goal. There are many people, who are honest, beautiful, good and soft spoken, intelligent and even faithful, but only some are successful in achieving their goal. While all of these characteristics are equally important and act as the medium for success, the most important is the power to cope with circumstances and keep our spirit goes on in the most difficult situations.
As it is well said that we cannot direct the wind but we can adjust the sail, similarly, in the way to our destination, we will come across lot of obstacles, but we need to find the way to come across that situation. This is where the success lies. No matter how low we fall, but what matters is how high we bounce back Success can be measured by what we have and how much of the power we are using to achieve our goal. For, example while in playing games, it is sure that one team will win and other will lose, but the spirit is not just in winning but also in learning new techniques and improving the team sprit and cooperation. Winner team cannot always be successful, but the successful team is the one, which has improved a lot with respect to its earlier performance.
Though the person is honest, intelligent, faithful and committed, it is not sure that he will be successful. The most important rather than these are to know the environment and the need, and implementing best of the best ideas and actions. No matter how smaller step it can be, but it can bring great changes. As Shiva Khera has said, “Winners don’t do different things but they do things differently”, better explains the meaning of being successful. Success is not just winning, but also more than that is how much we are satisfied with whatever we are doing. So, all qualities like honesty, intelligence, and faithfulness are directly proportional to the success.
The definition of success for each of us may vary. Some may think root cause for success is honesty while others may think it is the commitment. But, in my opinion, where there is will there is power, so each of us should know our strength, and work accordingly to be successful.

In my opinion, this is a very good idea, because it will improve the quality of teaching. Also, students would be more interested in attending classes. Finally, the school would improve its reputation in the community.
Firstly, students would have great benefit from such a survey. If students were not satisfied with a teacher, they would be offered a chance to express their opinion. This way they would have their say about their own education. Their opinion should not be accepted as an absolute truth, but should always be heard and taken into consideration. Indeed, bad evaluation by the student population doesn't necessarily mean that the teacher is bad. For example, if students claim that certain teacher is not good, it may mean that the teacher isn't competent, but it may also mean that students don't pay enough attention to what he is saying, or that they should spend more time studying. By expressing their opinion, students can make teachers prepare better for their lectures or explain the content more clearly and with more enthusiasm. Therefore, students would be able to understand the lectures better and consequently to get higher grades. Furthermore, the students would be motivated to pay more attention during classes and to listen to lectures more regularly, since they will be asked to give their own opinion about what they've heard.
Secondly, this kind of survey would also be useful for teachers. Good teachers should be rewarded financially or otherwise. On the other hand, the teacher who receives low grade from his students should be sanctioned, for example by lowering his salary. In extreme cases, he should be fired. This way he would be forced to improve his teaching skills in order to keep his job or raise his salary. Therefore, he would become a more competent teacher and better educator. This would improve the overall quality of education in the school.
Finally, this survey would be useful for the school and it's reputation. If a school asks students to evaluate teachers, it means that students have their freedom of expression and that the authority of the teachers does not intimidate them. The school would be more popular among prospective students, who would be more interested in enrolling that particular school. Also, its sponsors more appreciated by the community would better fund the school.
In conclusion, if the students were asked by the school to evaluate their teachers, it would benefit everyone. Teachers would be obligated to constantly improve quality of their lectures to avoid bad evaluation. Students would enjoy better education, and they would pay more attention in classes, since they would be able to influence the quality of the classes.

110.txt,"My personal belief is that the best way to learn about life is through personal experience. But this does not mean that I totally disregard the alternative way of learning by listening to family or friends’ advice. The truth is that now, at my age, I clearly see that the best way of learning about life would be a combination of the two (ways noted above).
The main reason I embrace the first way is because I find it more natural, it is our instinctive way to act and react. When we are young we are prone to experience than to listen to other persons advice and less to the advice coming from our family. This may not be a general case but I believe the exceptions are rare. I remember when I got engaged with my future husband both my parents and friends were very much against my decision. And in a way they were right. But I wanted to follow my heart and to have my own judgment even if people with more experience and even good intention were advising me to do the contrary. My reaction/action it was also influence by the wrong approach my family adopted. And my case is not an isolated one.
From my above story can be inferred that I DO agree that learning by listening to the advice of well-intended people is a wise way. It would probably save us some grief and disappointment in life. But I strongly believe that even painful the experience we choose to have is helping us grow and builds our personality. I never regretted my decision to get marry at a pretty early age even if eventually we (me and my husband) ended up divorcing. It was one of the best experience I ever had, though the most painful in my life.
I conclude by encouraging youngsters to try to listen both to their heart and to other persons advice and judge which way would be the best for them. Although I sound like my mother some years ago, when she tried to convince me that at my age the marriage is not the best choice in life, I strongly recommend to everybody to accept listening to any advice before making a decisive step in life and afterwards to filter all these information.

Moreover, I understand success to refer to one’s ability to achieve the predominant part of his goals in his lifetime, which in turn leads to a correlation between success and income since the accomplishment of such a natural goal as to provide a good future for your loved ones demands the means. What is the simplest and most lawful way to earn enough to consider you a successful person? To receive a good education and to find a good job. Both receiving an education and making a career presuppose one’s readiness to work hard, and success without hard work is simply not possible for the vast majority of the world's population. The reasons and examples listed below will strengthen my point of view.
First of all, considering an education and a career as key factors of success, one will choose to pursue a degree from a college or a university. One wishing to be admitted to the university will have to take several tests. It is doubtful that someone will be so lucky that knowing nothing; he could pass the test with a high score. A low score means failure, and that test taker will not likely be admitted. Therefore, in order to be successful, one should prepare for the tests and work hard, because a good education will provide him with a good job and an opportunity to accomplish some of his goals and dreams. In my lifetime, I have never met a person who could graduate from a college without working hard.
Secondly, it is impossible to make a career if one is indolent and lacking knowledge, at least in developed countries. Luck plays no role in achieving this success. Even if someone was unbelievably lucky enough to become a manager not being qualified enough, he will be asked to resign in the near future because of his inability due to lack of knowledge and experience to make right decisions. For instance, I used to work for a very small company owned by a friend. This company was later closed because of bankruptcy. The cause of bankruptcy was wrong strategies and decisions made by the owner. After the failure, he went to a university and worked for another company so that he could obtain experience and become a successful businessman. Nowadays, he considers himself a successful person because he had turned into reality his two biggest dreams of producing consumer goods of high quality and making charitable donations to needy people.
In sum, as long as someone understands success as an ability to turn into reality some of his dreams and goals, he will have to work hard because he will need money. And his chances to earn that money will remarkably increase if he could graduate from a college and make a career. All of these things are simply not possible without hard work. Luck has no place in such a scheme of events.",0.9997,0.0003,HUMAN
76.txt,"Traveling is one of the best ways to enjoy ourselves. Many people like to travel and see different places. Some people travel alone and discover new places. Other people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide. Because I like meeting new people and like to learn as much as possible about the places I visit, I would prefer to travel with a group of people led by a tour guide. In this essay, I will explain my reasons.
First of all, by traveling in a group, we can benefit from the travel knowledge of our tour guide and our traveling companions and from the language skills of our tour guide. Without knowledge of the language, we might have great difficulty in communication. Also we should search for the places that we are going to visit in order to not to waste time. Because most of us are not professional tour guides, we cannot know all the important places that have to be visited. Tour guides can help us in different situations. So, traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better than traveling alone. Many tour guides know at least two foreign languages, so they help us to communicate when we have trouble. Tour guides also give us information about the places that we visit, so the trip becomes even more informative.
Secondly, meeting new people can be very interesting when we travel in a group. We can build friendships that last forever. For example, two years ago, with my cousin, I went to Paris with on a tour with a group. There were almost thirty people in our group. We got along with each other very well. We went to restaurants all together, and it was really fun. If the number of people in a tour increases then, the transportation and hostelling costs decrease, and people can visit more places with less money.
In conclusion, I can say that traveling in a group of people is the best way to travel. Traveling in a group allows us to save money, make good friends, have companionship, and learn important information about the place that we are visiting.",0.2316,0.7684,HUMAN
62.txt,"Playing games has always been thought to be important to the development of well-balanced and creative children; however, what part, if any, they should play in the lives of adults has never been researched that deeply. I believe that playing games is every bit as important for adults as for children. Not only is taking time out to play games with our children and other adults valuable to building interpersonal relationships but is also a wonderful way to release built up tension.
There's nothing my husband enjoys more after a hard day of work than to come home and play a game of Chess with someone. This enables him to unwind from the day's activities and to discuss the highs and lows of the day in a non-threatening, kick back environment. A close friend received one of my most memorable wedding gifts, a Backgammon set. I asked him why in the world he had given us such a gift. He replied that he felt that an important aspect of marriage was for a couple to never quit playing games together. Over the years, as I have come to purchase and play, with other couples & coworkers, many games like: Monopoly, Chutes & Ladders, Mastermind, Dweebs, Geeks, & Weirdoes, etc. I can reflect on the integral part they have played in our weekends and our ""shut-off the T.V. and do something more stimulating"" weeks. They have enriched my life and made it more interesting. Sadly, many adults forget that games even exist and have put them away in the cupboards, forgotten until the grandchildren come over.
All too often, adults get so caught up in working to pay the bills and keeping up with the ""Joneses'"" that they neglect to harness the fun in life; the fun that can be the reward of enjoying a relaxing game with another person. It has been said that ""man is that he might have joy"" but all too often we skate through life without much of it. Playing games allows us to: relax, learn something new and stimulating, interact with people on a different more comfortable level, and to enjoy non-threatening competition. For these reasons, adults should place a higher priority on playing games in their lives.",0.9879,0.0121,HUMAN

First of all, the natural gas can enhance the ability of competition in price. There is a litte resource to produce in our country, so we must import it. Discovery of natural gas provided power plant and company energy to produce goods to export. Thus, we could save the money to spend to run plants. Therefore the price of production was lowed.

163.txt,"It is a very dangerous thing to say that basic literacy skills are more important now than they have ever been in the past. While a strong argument can be made in favor of this idea, making such an argument would imply that reading and writing were somehow less important in the past. While there is a grain of truth to the argument that literacy was not fundamental to the daily existence of most people in the pre-Industrial Revolution period, rationalizing such a lack of need for education in such a way is the first step to withholding education from certain groups, a great social crime that has led to the disempowerment of disadvantage groups all over the world throughout history. However, if we can keep in mind that education is a basic human right, then we can discuss the strengths of the proposition that literacy is more important now than it has ever been before.
It is true that in the past the majority of people all over the world made their livelihood from agricultural activities and that the vast majority of these activities required little or no literacy skills. In some senses, we could argue that literacy skills were less important in the agricultural age than they are now, but to do so would be to forget that literacy also reflects an active mind and that people have always needed to engage in activities of the mind. For example, even though a farmer might have labored all day in her cornfield, she may enjoy reading the latest Jane Austen novel when arrived at home. We can see in this example that while literacy was not directly related to this laborer's livelihood, literacy was important to her quality of life.
However, we could make a good argument that literacy is more important now that it was in the past. As we all know, the world is experiencing a revolution that may turn out to be more important than the Industrial Revolution. We are now entering the Information Age, an age in which information and knowledge have more value than the ability to build machines, create ""stuff,"" grow crops, or even mine precious metals and produce gemstones. Nowadays, accurate information may be worth more than the most expensive Rolls Royce or the biggest diamond. The perfect example of this increasing dominance is the explosive rise in the popularity of the Internet--the Internet offers the world countless bytes of information twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. Companies all over the world, but principally in the United States, are rushing to stake their claim in cyberspace and stiff competition among companies has resulted. In order to gain dominance, these companies must have the best-skilled workers, an advanced understanding of computer systems, and good intuition about what will happen in the future. All of these abilities to compete in the global marketplace stem directly from literacy skills and those without these skills will be stuck in the service, agricultural, and heavy industry fields.
In short, we can see that people in the past who were lacking in literacy skills essentially had more company than those lacking these skills have today and could still earn their livelihood. Further, we could argue that because of the nature of the global marketplace and because of the emergence of the Information Age, we could make the argument that literacy is fundamental to professional success nowadays. However, literacy should be considered a basic human right in a literate society--all people throughout history should have learned to read and write.",0.9959,0.0041,HUMAN

176.txt,"Most countries already have many holidays. In my country, Taiwan, we have nineteen official holidays. However, I believe that my new holiday, ""Walking Day"" would be very beneficial and should be added to the nineteen holidays Taiwan already has. In this essay, I will outline the three main reasons why ""Walking Day"" would be a very good holiday.
First, walking is good exercise. As we all know, people all over the world are becoming busier and busier. They are studying more and more so that they can have better jobs. When they work, they are working more and more. As a result, people have less time for other important things in their lives, including exercise. We can read reports in the newspapers everyday about people who have worse health and complain about poor health condition. Exercising more could reduce many of these problems and walking is one of the best and simplest exercises for people.
Second, by walking, we can reduce pollution and thereby protect the environment. As technology improves all over the world and people have more and more money, they are starting to use this money to buy automobiles. As a result, people are using public transportation less and less. Driving one's own car every day has had a very large impact on the environment as a result of the pollution created by gas burning automobiles. Walking is the perfect way to reduce pollution since there are so many other benefits as well.
Finally, by walking, people can slow down the pace of their lives. Perhaps this is one of the greatest benefits of walking more. Life at the beginning of the new millennium is stressful--people are competing with each other for better jobs, countries and companies are competing with each other for business. Many people start to forget about the importance of slowing down in their lives, of simply enjoying the moment. People need to contemplate life more. Walking is a perfect opportunity to slow down, think about life, and simply enjoy the big, beautiful world that we live in.
Finally, we could celebrate this holiday by encouraging people to walk instead of driving or taking the bus for at least one trip during the day. I believe that people could find at least one trip during the day that they could make on foot instead of some other form of transportation. For example, if people usually drive to a large supermarket to buy food, perhaps they could walk to a closer, smaller market to buy only a few things. I believe that while people were walking, they would be able to enjoy the exercise and the fresh air and would be able to think calmly and clearly.
In short, if I had to create a new holiday, I would create ""Walking Day"" because of the many simple benefits it could provide us.",0.997,0.003,HUMAN
63.txt,"Parents and adult relatives play a significant role in shaping a child's life. They teach them how to live, and struggle for the right things. However when children grow up, often they fail to realize the contributions of their parents and adult relatives in their lives. Teenage children think that being a teenager they are able to make all the decisions of their lives. In my opinion, parents and adult relatives should make important decisions for their teenage children because teenagers are inexperienced, overconfident and many times they do not realize the consequences that the important decisions can have on their lives.
Teenagers, being new in the adult world and having their first experiences of their adult lives, think themselves as grownups and perfectly able to make their own decisions. However, most of the times, their friends influence their decisions. For example a student may get into a top university, but just because his/her friend is going to college, he/she wishes to go to college too. In this case the decision is obviously influential, and can have great negative effects on his/ her life. At such a point the parents or the adult relatives should make decisions for their children.
Another reason why parents or the adult relatives decisions are very important is that the teenagers are over confident. The teenagers haven’t still been into practical life, and they don’t have an idea of how the practical world works. Especially before the university, teenagers are living in kind of a fantasy world, where they think everything is cool and perfect. For example they might think that playing basketball in the school gym is definitely going to get them selected on the national team. This may be true in some cases, but usually it doesn’t work out this way. So if the teenager just neglects his/her studies, he/she is going to be definitely in loss. At such points, like choosing the subjects in high school, parents and/or adult relatives should make decisions for their teenage children.
In conclusion, although teenagers might think the decisions being imposed on them as a stone in their paths, it is infect a blessing for them. Teenagers, being irresponsible, and inexperienced are not always able to make decisions for themselves. Hence parents and/or adult relatives should make the decisions for them.",0.9996,0.0004,HUMAN

Of course it is a free choice to attend many classes or to specialize in one subject. But I rather attend university that requires students to take classes in many subjects.

Imagine if everyone takes their time to do every thing that they should do, things wouldn't be done on time, there would be chaos, anarchy and total disorder.

Since computers revolution in the 80’s, personal computers have expanded so greatly and fast that today almost every organization bases their activities on computers. They are everywhere we go, in banks, supermarkets, offices, public organisms, etc, automating repeatable operations.

At least two cities, Mexico City and Sao Paulo have almost 30 million inhabitants. In this context, one could say that a gift of land is the greatest gift of all. Land is perhaps the most permanent thing in the world. Unlike diamonds, which really have little value in and of themselves, land actually has great value. Unlike televisions and cars, land cannot be destroyed—if you remove land, there is still more land under it. In this context, I will discuss what I would do were I given some land as a gift. It will be necessary, however, to discuss four things first: First, it is necessary to establish the size of the land. Second, we need to know where the land is. Third, the topography of the land is important. Finally, the weather in the location is fundamental.
For the purposes of this essay, I will assume that I have received a rather large parcel of land (it is a gift, right?) in a temperate climate with four seasons. I will assume that the land is fairly flat. Most importantly, I will assume that this land is mine and that I have control over the land, i.e., that no other government controls the land.
Having grown up in a rather poor family, I think I would be quite excited about receiving some land. I have never owned anything of any great value and to own some land would be a wonderful thing for me. For a long time, it has been a dream of mine to be able to build a beautiful house for my mother. My mother is still living in poverty and it saddens me to think of her living in that situation. She often does not have enough money to use the heat in the wintertime and cannot afford to buy new clothes. I would love to be able to give her the gift of a house and a happy place to live for the rest of her life. Since we lived in a country with very cold winters, my family often felt very cold. I would love to bring my mother to a warm place to spend the rest of her days.
However, I would not devote all of the land to houses for my family. I would use most of the land to develop a business. In my case, doing this would be very important since I grew up poor. I would need to ensure that I would have a source of income and a way to sustain the activities on the land. An efficient way to do this would be to develop the land in some way suitable to the land. In this case, I would use the land to develop a language and confidence training camp. It has long been my dream to build a perfect language-learning center—a place where people could go to learn a language, to immerse them in the language, to meet other people and to have fun while doing so. In conclusion, I would like to make one more point. I must admit that I feel somewhat guilty about the idea of accepting such a gift of land. There is a part of me that is somewhat idealistic and would like to think that the world is a beautiful place and that all humans should live together peacefully. From this viewpoint, I would say that no one could own land. As an American Indian once said, “Own the land? You might as well own the air or the sky!” However, this idea is inconsistent with the world today. Being more realistic, I would do what I detailed above.",0.2304,0.7696,HUMAN

Grades enable a person to assess his capacities and disabilities. By looking at one's grade one can roughly tell how well one knows his subject. And this enables a person to overcome his flaws and improve his knowledge on the subject he is weak in.
Grades increase a sense of competitiveness. We usually work hard to get more marks then our friends and classmates. Grades provide a base and reason for this sense of competitiveness. If there were no grades people wouldn’t bother much about enhancing their knowledge and would take their studies easy.
Grades tend to develop an interest towards studies. In today’s world where most of the students consider studying a burden, a bad grade in their subjects would initiate them to do better. This would enhance their knowledge.
Grades either good or bad are beneficial to students. If one gets a bad grade, he would be embarrassed and would thrive to work hard thereby improving his scores and knowledge.

In my opinion, these people are thinking a little bit selfish, because there are other things that a business should do, for example considering the workers, costumers. Beside all these a business should serve the community.
The most important thing to realize is that, a person who is serving the costumers and the community should always be honest. In my opinion honesty is the most important quality a business should have in order to deserve the profit it makes. Earning money by playing trick on consumers or getting more money than it deserves is so bad that I don’t think a business which makes profit out of dishonesty can carry on with success. In a business all the workers must consider the other workers, the costumers and the community they live in. Colleagues are also very important; they should respect each other and should never forget that business is teamwork. If a business is making large profits, it should share it with the people who made that profit possible. If a worker cannot get what he deserves either economically or mentally he may not be able to work effectively in the future.
The other important thing is that some of the profits one’s business earns from the community should be returned to the community. For example if big company is earning a lot of money, it should never forget that the money comes from community so it should return some of the profit back to community. There are various ways to do it. For example a company can built a park for the children or crèche just like public nursery for the children of the workers, get the trust of the workers.
The last very important point is to get customers’ trust. A small company may grow into a large company after sometime but if it wants to be long lasting, it should always try to produce high-quality products, and give good service to its costumers.
Generally, it can be said that the most important thing for a business is to make a profit; a business should never do anything to make a large profit.

The daughter is expected being of tender and gentle so that she would get married a good man that means she would have a good fortune and her parents would not be worried because she does not make a living herself. As a good son or daughter, one of the most important qualities is he or she has to be obedient and submissive everything for their parent.

Of course, doing homework will scare our leisure time in some extent, but it can help students understand the texts more deeply, force students to review the texts and make students have a lasting impression about the texts. So personally, I would prefer to do homework everyday.
There are numerous reasons why I think that daily homework is necessary for students, and I would here explain some of the most important ones. The main reason is daily homework can help students understand the texts more deeply. It can be given an example; you must make yourself understand the texts firstly in order to do your homework. Whatever in mathematics, in chemistry or other courses, if you don't understand the texts, you cannot finish the homework of that day.
The other reason is that daily homework can force the students to review the texts. Just imagine when you have the problems in your homework you will understand it more. When you have the problems, what can make you work out is reading your texts and your notes carefully or discussing with other students.
One very strong argument is that doing homework can make the students have a lasting impression about the texts. In order to see it clearly, let us see an example. When students do their homework, they have to review the texts, understand the texts; even more discuss the problems about the texts. They gradually have a lasting impression about the texts.
From what has been discussed above, doing homework has more advantages, so we finally draw the conclusion that daily homework is necessary for students.",0.9949,0.0051,HUMAN

First of all nowadays we live in several times more polluted environment than our ancestors. And life conditions are getting worse every day. I think that companies can do a lot of things about that. They can even raise their profits helping the society. Recently, I read in a newspaper about a complaint of McDonalds to plant trees in order to prevent further destruction of the ozone layer. They received approval from the society and increased their profits. So that companies can follow them and help to save our environment.
Secondly, I think that protecting the environment, the company helps every single member of the society. I have in mind all the deceases that have occurred during the last sentury. These, so called ""new era"" deceases, like all allergies, are due to the polluted air. Many companies can make an effort and use special equipment in their product ional process in order to restrict the air pollution.

Some movies are serious, designed to make audience think the others are designed primarily to entertain and amuse. I 'm fan of the movies and watch both types of movies but to tell you the truth I enjoy more those with that entertain. Why? I explain it.
Our lives are very dynamic; we compete with others about our jobs and other stuff we are always in the run. That's why, when I sit down to enjoy a movie, I want to be relaxed. Especially, for me are good the comedies in which I can laugh until I get tears in my eyes. Laughter is good for us and we all need that. And that can get it in a good movie [comedy0) like ""Liar, Liar"".
On the other hand, movies that are more serious and make us think, we have to be very concentrated to follow the happenings, and sometimes can make us sad or have bad influence on us. When I was watching the movie ""a shot through the heart "" which theme was the war in Bosnia, it make me sad and I felt anger in the same time against enemy.

71.txt,"Almost everyone of us come at some point of our lives comes to the realization that we might have missed something on the way and we want to go back for a moment and take that thing before we continue. Many times this is expressed via the unexpected desire to study something we might have had the chance, but we before we never took it. For me such thing is astronomy. It appeals to me in so many ways, the mystery that accompanies the science of the universe has always attracted me in some magic way but I never took my chance. Now, if I am given such, I will not hesitate much before I take and below are some of my reasons for doing so.
Astronomy is the science that tries to give us a more profound knowledge about the Universe - the unimaginably big world that we are just a tiny part of. It give us a better look at worlds that we've never imagined exist and within the whole picture it tries to explain our own existence the way it is. Everyone of us has looked at the starry sky at night and at least a brief thought has come through out head of what's there, what are all this flickering lights and is somebody waiting for us millions of lights years away. Thoughts like this have always made us feel a little bit better in our existence, a little bit less lonely in our universe and science like Astronomy is that one that prove our hopes true, to make the dreams reality.
On the other hand, Astronomy helps us understand better who we are, where do we come from, what is our place in the big picture and how do we function as an entity within it. Let's take for example the studies on the structure of the matter in the universe. Astronomers have proven the existence of substances that we considered unthinkable before and the knowledge they get from this inventions helps is go beyond the visible part in our own world, find the secrets of the matter that are hidden deeply in its existence on earth. We shouldn't also forget the recent discoveries regarding the Big Bang, considered the creation point of the Universe the way we know it today, and the help they provide us on understanding our origin as living beings. It helps us understand where are we heading for.
Taking all of the above mentioned, I can easily conclude that Astronomy for me is a way to broaden my mind, a way to look beyond the visible part of the world I live in, a feeling of belonging somewhere in the whole picture of the universe and, most of all, astronomy the knowledge that provides me with the confidence and hope that living beings on Earth are not alone in their existence.",0.9996,0.0004,HUMAN

Although most experiences in our lives seem difficult, after overcome problems that these experiences involved, they become valuable lessons for the future.
Difficult experiences demand people to be strong. In my own experience, for instance, I lived one of the most difficult situation that a human being can live, which is to lose the most valuable person: the mother. Because I lost my mother when I was seven years old, I learned how to be responsible and take care of myself, and now I am an independent and strong person who can face any difficulty for severe that seemed.
On the other hand, sometimes, difficult situations offer challenges that can change one’s life. For example, five years ago I won a scholarship to study a Master degree, and in compensation for this grant I was asked to do some work for the University where I was studying. They proposed me to be a teacher. Although I felt fearful and unconfident at the beginning, I accepted that challenge and I became to be an excellent teacher.
Finally, after overcome difficult situations people are able to handle any problem in a better way because they are already familiar dealing with unpleasant experiences. My own case illustrates it. After loosing my mother and being a teacher without previous experience, I have developed skills like control of stress and work under pressure that has allowed me to face any problem o challenge.

Man is born free but he is in chains. He has various duties to perform. He must earn bread for his family. But in doing so he must not be devoted to his work so much that he has little time stored for his family and friends. Because there are times when he should give some time for his family. To strengthen the family ties, it is essential.
Now a day the society has gone to astray because there is no family value. Parents are busy with their work. Children do not find their parents most of the time. So they are with their friends most of the time and if they choose wrong friends then they are likely to go down the drain. But if parents are beside them at their time of need, then they won’t feel lonely. Parent-children relation will grow.
Money is essential but it is not the only thing we should run after. If a friend is in need, we should be by his side. If a relative is ill, we should manage some time to see him. And most of all if our family needs us, we should put aside all jobs and be there. We cannot escape from our duties by just saying that we are too busy in our work. We should keep our priorities in order.
Finally, it can be said that we earn money for our happiness and for the comfort of our family. In doing so we should not forget our ultimate goal. If we do, then our families will be in a disaster.

These visiting increase city's poverty, wealth and reputation. Moreover these developments lead a city more attractive and clean.

9.txt,"Television is undoubtedly one of the most powerful means of communication in the history of humankind, rivaled only by such other forms of communication as the Internet, the telephone, movies, and, of course, simple, low-tech speech. Television, with its wide availability and rich media with image and sound, is difficult to ignore and even seductive in its appeal. Television is as much a part of our lives as are our meals, work, or school; studies consistently show that the average American child spends almost as much time watching television as she does in school. Furthermore, because television is so rich in its media, it often requires our full attention or is more attraction to us than are our daily lives. Naturally, the more time one spends watching television, the less time she has with her family and friends. Thus, we can clearly see why some have claimed that television has been harmful for communication among family and friends. However, I believe that, while television has been somewhat harmful in its effects, it has hardly ""destroyed"" communication among family and friends for most people, although for some, this may be true.
Most people much prefer spending time with their families and friends to spending time watching television. Television is of course an important part of many people's lives, but most people would gladly choose family and friends over television were they given the choice. Furthermore, most educated people are aware of the deleterious effects of too much television and either avoid excessive time watching television, or actually do not enjoy it. I, for example, after a long day at work, would much rather spend time talking with my wife and playing with my children than I would watching some unrealistic portrayal of life on television. For my family, and me our time together is precious and beautiful, and could never be replaced or hurt by television.
Furthermore, the effect of television is simply not so great that it could be said to have ""destroyed"" communication among family and friends. Granting that communication among family and friends in industrialized countries has decreased in recent years, it might be tempting to blame this problem on television since its rise roughly coincided with the decrease in time we spend with our families. However, I believe this situation is more likely due to increased pressures relating from work, school, and the economy. In my case, for example, I find that my pressures from work are so great that I must often sacrifice time at home so that I can meet the challenges of running my own business. Many of my friends are in similar situations--my best friend, for example, has just finished law school, which took about sixty hours a week of his time. In a word, people nowadays have very little time for anything, but television is not the cause--it is increased desire to succeed.
In some situations, however, television has surely contributed to a decrease in communication among family members. In my childhood in the countryside, I often saw parents and children watching television for hours on end, rarely speaking with one another. It seemed for them that television was a way to escape from their sad, miserable existence. However, even in this case, I would say that television merely contributed to the bad situation, but did not cause it; were television not existent, surely these people would have found other escapes, alcohol or gambling, for example. In other words, people always find a way to do what they want to do.
In short, I do not believe that television has destroyed or even harmed interpersonal communication among most people. Most people realize that television is merely a temporary diversion and do not use it to replace interpersonal communication. I believe that the damage attributed to television is greatly exaggerated and that such damage is most likely attributable to other more powerful social factors.",0.998,0.002,HUMAN
98.txt,"Modern life has become so demanding nowadays that everyone is facing the problem of stress. In order to escape the stress due to work pressure people try out different ways to become stress free. These include reading, gardening, cycling, playing and many more things as per their choice. For me the best ways to escape stress are listening to music of your choice, going on a short trip and spending time with family. The reasons for the above choices are mentioned below.
Firstly, listening to good music is the best way to escape from stress as because it takes us into a different world. While listening to the sweetly composed tunes it makes us forget all the worldly worries. Also we can listen to music anywhere using portable systems. This helps us in avoiding stress whenever we feel so. Therefore I think listening music is an excellent way to avoid stress.
Secondly, going on a short trip refreshes us and helps us to escape stress. Whenever we go for such trips we just leave aside our daily routine and just try to relax. We enjoy doing things out of the daily schedule. So this change simply lifts our spirits and helps us to escape stress.
Also whenever we spent time with our family, we talk our heart out to our loved ones, listen to their sweet thoughts and play like a child with the young ones. All these helps us releasing all our thoughts, which create, stress and make us young and fresh at heart.
In conclusion, I would like to say again that listening to music, going for a trip and spending time with family certainly releases stress as supported by the above-mentioned points.",0.9998,0.0002,HUMAN

They are paying money and don't see any result. Their kids do not learn too much. May be its teacher's fault. May be parents should pay less money? A lot of parents think like this. But I disagree with the statement that teachers should be paid according to how much their students learn.
I think that everything depends on a student and his willingness to study. So why should teachers be paid according to students desire? Teachers help us to understand a lot of things from the books if we cannot afford them. And if students do not want to study, why should teachers suffer?
Teachers have been studying for many years. They became teachers through so many difficulties and efforts. As far as I know if you want to be a teacher you have to study a lot. You have to get very good education, because you will take responsibility for the rest of your life-to teach others since you have finished the education. That means that the teachers spent a lot of time, energy to get their degree. And I think that they have already deserved to be well paid.
People were always paid for their knowledge. As much as you know, as much as you are awarded. I think that teachers know a lot, in such a way they should be paid well for their knowledge. And it does not depend on how much their students learnt. I think that there is no bad teachers- there are only bad students. And if the student explains lack of his knowledge because of a teacher that means that he never tried. He never tried to study; he never tried to ask his teacher for help, he never wanted to get more than his laziness.

I know that my husband has not returned from work yet, simply because his car is not in the garage. I am alone. I carefully check all the rooms, almost expecting something to happen suddenly. I hold my bag in my hand as if it were a weapon. After the whole house has been declared “clear,” I start to breathe normally again and a smile appears on my face as I realize, once again, how a simple movie seen at the cinema a week earlier can modify my actions.
Sometimes I wonder if I should watch TV, with all its shows that make me wonder whether I exercise enough, whether I am slim enough, or whether I treat my pets with the care they deserve: am I really concerned about their mental health??? Not to mention the hundreds of commercials that try to make me believe I need a water purifier to remain alive since the water I am currently drinking is heavily polluted! And countless are the times when I have heard people talking by quotations learned from movies… We need to watch shows and films to know what to say, how to be, how to act. We are so addicted to all this that it almost seems like we cannot think on our own.
I cannot help thinking about what happened to me some days ago, an example that clearly shows what kind of power TV has over people. My husband and I were in a restaurant when I heard my young neighbor pronouncing violent words in a low angry voice. Surprised, I turned to better understand the situation and I saw that he was holding a fake military device and was acting as if he were filming a war movie. I am sure that if I had been a little be more updated about this type of movie, I would have recognized what he was saying as a quotation. Now, I wonder if he uses such a language also with his friends and with his parents, if he is aggressive, and if so, whether his attitude has really nothing to do with what he watches on TV.
That same evening on the way home I saw two cars stopped one next to the other at a traffic light and as soon as the light turned green they started racing, in the middle of town. In this case not even a major knowledge of movies and TV programs would have helped me: there are just to many of them on the market showing the exact same thing: people racing with cars.
I am sure that everybody, if asked, could easily list many other examples of how TV and movies can modify our behavior and therefore our life but, I wonder, if we will always be able to draw the line between a TV show and real life, between what they make us think we want and what instead we really need and are and believe.",0.9998,0.0002,HUMAN

57.txt,"Someone says that a person should make an important decision alone, but in my opinion, I think that it is not true because everything can be looked in various aspects, and everyone has different skill and experiences. Consequently, consulting other persons is the best way for making a decision.
In my point of view, anyone in this world thinks differently from any other persons because there are many aspects for thinking about something. The more the number of people who help think, the more idea, so a person should not make an important decision alone. For example, in prominent company, it is very famous to work with team because the more the number of co-workers, the more a number of good ideas. Everyone has a chance to propose his opinion, and all of these opinions will be merged to be the conclusion decision.
In addition, making a decision alone can make people waste many things such as money, friends, or life because no one have a good skill in every fields. For example, in the business, if owner want to increase budget to develop a company, but he decides to do so by himself without consulting with accountancies that are good at calculating budget, the business may be turn down. So, the owner has to waste a lot of money because he makes an importance decision alone.
Moreover, it is sure that everyone cannot used to face with the same situation in his whole life, so no one has the same experiences, as do any other persons. Doing something that we used to do is easy and has less chance to do wrong, so If a person has to decide to do something that he used not to do so, but he consult with someone who used to do so, he can do so too. For example, last 6 years ago, I had to decide in which faculty that I should study. In that time, I had not many experiences, so I asked about the characteristic of any faculties from my parents, my teachers, and my parent’s friends who work in various careers. Those advices that everyone gave me were very useful for me to make a decision, and right now I am sure that I do not make a wrong decision that I choose to learn in the faculty of Electrical Engineering. If that time I decided to choose it by myself, I might be a doctor who was not happy at all.
To conclude, making an important decision is the important thing in people’s life because it can point out our life such as being the rich or the poor, working as an engineer or a doctor, or being happy or sad.

Education (books) and experience are the main two channels for People to gain their knowledge. Each plays different roles for people. In my opinion, knowledge from experience is more important than that from books.
Experience first can prove if the knowledge formbooks are true or false. Textbooks are very wonderful in teaching people essential principles, how is the world looks like? What is the basic law of change of people and things? We can learn a lot through primary school, secondary school until university.

There are two reasons that support this view. The first reason is that all the creatures on the face of the earth have the same right to exist, be it a four-legged animal or a human, both have the same right--just because humans have more so-called intelligence than do animals doesn't necessarily mean that they are naturally entitled to use any land as they wish.
The second reason is that for the existence of humans on earth, the existence of other creatures is essential. I say this because the presence of all the animals is essential to maintain natural order. We have seen the consequences of upsetting this balance in many environmental problems such as global warming.
Furthermore, animals are a necessary part of our lives on Earth. For example consider the food chain of the rat, snake, and eagle. We know that certain types of eagles are endangered species. If the eagle is hunted to the point where it becomes non-existent, then the food chain will be broken. As a result of this, the number of snakes will increase. This will result in greater environmental problems and could harm the lives of humans.
If the endangered animals are not protected the existence of humans will be in danger. Our history has shown that if we continue to exploit our resources, particularly by destroying the land and therefore the natural habitat of plants and animals, we will ultimately harm ourselves.

It is very important to be socialized. All the organizations and even homes will have a good environment if all members can cooperate. Working in a group means gaining leadership spirit, knowing each other, respect for each other, perfection, sharing ideas and knowledge, time consuming, easy decision making and over all accurate result.

Due to his realistic approach, our country was able to free itself from the shackles of injustice and slavery.
Mahatma Gandhi was an advocate by profession but he spent his entire life for his country and lived a most simple and disciplined life. He invented the spinning wheel, which was meant to teach the people of the country a means of producing their own cloth for wearing instead of relying upon the foreign goods. The superior example of his simplicity and determination to achieve anything in life is an inspiration for the generations to come.
In conclusion, Mahatma Gandhi in my opinion truly deserves the respect of people and also the title given to him as the father of the Nation. Any monument/statue in his memory can prove to be a mark of respect for the great personality.",0.9981,0.0019,HUMAN
95.txt,"Most of the students might have lived with roommates while studying in school or university. In most of the cases, it is true when the students went to the universities. I would prefer to have the characteristics of the roommates are co-operative, competitive and generous.
The one important quality of the good roommate is the generous, as the student stay most of the time with the roommate; he should be kind enough to share our sorrows and happiness. For instance, during my study in university once I felt sick before annual examinations. My roommate was taken me to the doctor and paid lot of attention till it gets cured. With out his kind, generous nature I would hasn’t recovered before the exams and I would have got low grade.
Also roommate should be competitive. This is because this will increase our studies growth a little bit faster and always try for the highest grade in the exams. At the same time we should not depress by looking at the roommate's progress in the exams. Infect, we should take that progress as a challenge and keep trying for the good grade. For example, I always used to take inspiration from my roommate percentage and used to get the more or less equal percentage with him. This resulted in increasing my position in class from top10 to top5 ranks.
Co-operation also one of the important quality of the good roommate. This would eventually helpful in sharing the knowledge of the subject and also resources like reference books and writing material. In my study days, once I couldn't attend the classes for one week due to ill. But as I have got my roommate such a cooperative person, I got to know the course details went on during that week and that was helped me a lot in follow up with the next courses.
As a whole from my point of view important qualities of good roommate are generous, competitive and co-operative",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN
42.txt,"Some people think ""never give up"" is a good attitude to life; others consider it is impossible never to give up because of the matters that surround us. I personally consider that ""never give up"" is not only good but is also appropriate attitude to life in order to succeed in this cruel world. In my opinion everybody must never give up himself when follows his aims. Even he has not achieved them he has to try again. Maybe next time he will succeed. I have always believed that this is the best way to survive. I will give you arguments to support my opinion.
First of all I think you have to trust yourself, realize your targets one by one, and never to give up in every difficult moment. People always have to put aims to their selves and follow them. When they achieve one aim they are satisfied of this success and put another aim to be reached. This is the man's nature. If you give up at the first problem you will lose belief in yourself and will reach nothing.
On the second place I would like to say that even if you fail you achieve much. Everybody knows that sometimes you cannot complete or even realize your goals because of the environment. I believe that you do not have to give up at first bad shot; you have to try again and again until you succeed. From the failures you learn how to proceed next time and revise your actions in order to thrive. I bet finally you will.
Last but not least ""never give up"" is the best way to survive in these days. If you do not have aims to achieve you are nothing. Your life will pass unnoticeably and you will be insignificant person that nobody sees. Many people around us always give us examples of never to give up. Ballet-dancers who were fractured their legs and with a lot of efforts manage to dance again because this is their main purpose. Deaf-and-dump people learn to communicate with gestures with the others. Thus give meaning of their lives. Undoubtedly reaching these targets is very hard but they never give up and they survive.
From the argument I have stated above it can be seen that no matter how difficult it is to realize your aims you have to never give up and this is the best attitude to life.",0.9994,0.0006,HUMAN
56.txt,"I strongly believe that people should never judge a person by external appearances. The way we look not always reflects the way we are. We can make huge mistakes if we let the external appearances tell us everything about someone.
I consider that outward qualities are related in some ways to the manner we are and the way we feel inside. Sometimes the clothes we chose express our mood, how we are feeling at that moment. Also, the hairstyle, make up and many other aspects of our look sometimes give an idea of our attitude towards life. Even though, not all aspects or, for some people, any aspect of the personality is shown in external appearances. The look is not evident enough to communicate deep feelings, beliefs, thoughts and behaviors. There is so much more inside of a person that can only be noticed after knowing him very well.
I have met people who give an erroneous first impression. At first sight one could describe them in a completely different way from what they turn to be when you get to know them well. Before making premature conclusions we should pay attention at many other features, such as the way the person talks, the words he uses, the look in his eyes that help us to recognize how is that person like. People’s values, educational background, skills and virtues lie in the inside, not in the outside.
There is a great risk of missing good friends if we allow us to judge by appearances. We always should give a second chance to people to show us how they really are, without masquerades. We have to be smart to not mistake what we see on the surface, because the main part of almost everything is hidden and not easily seen.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN
68.txt,"When children attend school, they spend most of their time with their classmates. Because of this reason many people think that classmates are a more important influence than parents on a child’s success in school. I totally agree with this statement in the light of my experiences and my other friends’ experiences. In this essay, I will try to figure out how classmates are an important influence on a child’s success in school.
First of all, at the very beginning of the school years, children meet new friends and they get close with some of them either because they get along with them well or they are in the same neighborhood. It is very normal for a child to have new friends that she likes and have enjoyable time but sometimes these classmates become a very important influence on a child’s behavior. This behavior can affect her positively or negatively. For example my cousin had had some friends at school. She liked them a lot but I felt something wrong as soon as I met them. I talked to my cousin about it but she didn’t listen to my advices. Later on she realized that her friends were using drugs and cut her relations with them. My cousin and her family had to move to another city because this event affected my cousin very much and she suffered some psychological problems. My cousin had to give up her school for a year and took her 2 years return to her normal life.
On the other hand, classmates can influence a child’s success in school in a good way. Because, to my way of thinking, meeting new people, getting to know them, is an important experience in one’s life. Studying together, helping each other with some problems is very useful. For example, I study with my friends for the exams and I think it is very helpful. One of my friends can solve a mathematics problem that the others cannot solve, so we complete each other. I sometimes don’t feel like studying but my friends force me to study and I thank them for that. Because sometimes one needs motivation and friends are there at this times.
Finally, we can say that classmates are an important influence on a child’s success in school. The important point is that how they influence a child’s success. And as long as we have good friends, they play an important role in our success.

Although significant portion of the past knowledge can't be directly applied to the present day, learning about the past creates opportunities for scientific discoveries, prevents from repeating mistakes of the past, and contributes to the understanding of the purpose of our existence. Technological progress is induced by new scientific discoveries that would never occur without knowledge of prior achievements in the certain scientific field. Major innovations occurring in the industry are based on new scientific theories put into practice. Discovery of micro particles - electrons, protons and neutrons- in Physics revealed the possibility of creating the flow of electrons under the influence of the magnetic field. Every production process today is based on this latter discovery of electric current, which wouldn't be made without past knowledge of electrons existence.
Besides providing knowledge of fundamental discoveries, past experience helps prevent reoccurrence of negative events in the history of our civilization. School children learn about world wars cited in the history textbooks so that when they grow up they don't repeat mistakes of their predecessors. One of the brightest examples is atomic bomb dropped on Japan during World War the Second. Knowledge of such negative experiences is necessary for humanity to continue its existence.
Moreover, learning about the past helps satisfy people's desire to understand who they are and why they exist. History and Religion are necessary for a discussion of these main philosophical questions. If people haven't been learning about the past, Bible texts, which give answers to these questions, would never be preserved till the present day. In the same time Bible is the main guide for majority of the world population today.
Consequently, it's imperative to learn about the past, because this knowledge is valuable for the development of our civilization. Technological progress, avoidance of past mistakes, and contribution to understanding of the purpose of existence can only be achieved through understanding of our predecessors' lives and deeds.",0.9891,0.0109,HUMAN
6.txt,"I am from Arroz e Feijao, a small town in the northeast of Brazil. Building a factory in there will bring a lot of advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that Arroz e Feijao will mostly benefit from the building of a new factory because it is largely populated by poor people and the factory would bring many benefits to this small town. However, of course, a factory has disadvantages as well.
As you know, factories usually bring pollution. If this factory is not managed very effectively and efficiently according to specific rules, it's prone to polluting the local air and water. What's more, factories usually make noise. Beside clean drinkable water and fresh air, an ideal community should be quiet. If the factory cannot maintain this situation to the community, it will not last long. A factory that is too noisy or pollutes too much will eventually be relocated to a new area.
On the other hand, a factory could bring a lot of benefits to the community. So I would support the plan to build a factory to my community for all the reasons I will describe below.
First of all, the factory's construction will surely improve the local infrastructure. To run smoothly, the factory will have to have a steady, reliable supply of water and electricity. Some old pipes will be changed, and some facilities will be renovated. The residents' living standard get improved as a result of these widespread changes, an important benefit in Arroz e Feijao, where many people do not have access to clean water.
Secondly, to make the employee commute more convenient, the local roads will have to be rebuilt and broadened, resulting in improved public transportation. The town's residents can take a public bus to go shopping or go to work. As a result, air pollution and fuel consumption might be reduced.
Most important, a factory's establishment will bring up a lot of employment opportunities for the community. A factory needs experts from various fields. The residents can take just a few minutes to go to the factory to work. So, the local residents can get great benefits from this factory.
Generally speaking, I agree with the plan to build a factory near my community. If the factory can be managed successfully, the factory and local residents can have mutual benefit.",0.9862,0.0138,HUMAN
83.txt,"Technology as we all know has changed the way we live our lives in this new millennium. It has affected each and every faucet of people from all countries irrespective of cultural and physical boundaries. Now many people may argue with the fact that, not all change brought due to the technological revolution has resulted in progress for the human kind. But I strongly support the argument that technology has made the world a better place to live. I will explain my point of view with examples and reasoning in the following paragraphs.
First of all, technology has improved the quality of our lives. For example, in our working lives where we use computers, which help us plan and execute our work faster. And also for instance the communication technology, which has revolutionized the way people around the world, talk and share information. Previously, pigeons were used to transmit information, now due to efforts of many scientists and organizations we have mediums such as e-mail, telephone, fax which allow people to share information, in ways which was never thought possible before. All this results in people meeting and sharing thoughts and exchanging knowledge, which eventually leads to betterment of mankind.
Secondly, It has made it possible to do things unimagined before. For instance, it was never thought possible to cure people of some diseases and disabilities. But path breaking applications of radioactive isotopes in cancer treatment and artificial limb implants in disabled persons are some instances where technology has given people a new ray of hope.
It has also resulted in increasing the efficiency of humans. A good example of this are the machines used in factories which are 1000 times more efficient in doing some repetitive tasks compared to humans. This results in industry being able to supply the increasing demands of the ever-increasing population. Good examples of this are cars and packaged food products.
Technology has also given us a second chance in case of unexpected events like diseases and natural calamities. Because of technology we can better respond to these problems. For example, vaccines are used extensively throughout the world when any particular pandemic or epidemic breaks out and now less life are lost due to natural disasters than before, thanks to the state of the art search and rescue equipment.
Lastly, it has given us a purpose of our life. For example space technology has strived to explain our origins in the universe. Meanwhile also finding the roots of our own evolution. All this results in a better understanding of the forces of nature controlling our existence and better utilizing them for our own good.
In conclusion, I fully support the statement that technology has made our world a better place to live and also gives us a means by which we can preserve the best of our world for future generations to come.",0.9996,0.0004,HUMAN

This curiosity caused many inventions and profits for the people around the world. In the other hand, we live together and we should think about others, have compassion for them and give their due. It is not fair that governments notice on their points and don’t think that it may harm other people. In my opinion, governments should spend money for our basic needs on earth and stop spending money for outer space researches.
If one person deprived himself and his family from eating to buy and run a car, we may consider him mad. It is not acceptable to spend millions of money’s funds and expenditures for space researches while there are many people around the world who have a severe lack of food, water, and hygiene and many other primary necessities. When we see that there is many violent thugs, suicides, robberies and divorces occur in our society and most of these problems are because of lack of money or poverty, It is not conventional to squander this huge amount of money for traveling to space while many essential requirements have not answered yet.

Deforesting caused many jungles destroyed; air pollution is going to be a very dangerous problem and so on.

People of different cultures dance differently and for varying purposes, it can express emotions, tell a story, religious or political needs, their varied forms of dance can reveal much about their life. Therefore dancing plays an important role in a culture.
The first characteristic of dance that can tell us about a certain culture is the body movement. By varying physical actions and using different dynamics, human being can fashion an infinite number of body movements. Out of the range of movements that the body is capable of performing, every culture emphasizes certain features in its dance styles. For example, rotating and leg lifting movements in ballet and European fog or pantomime and symbolic gestures may be used in Asian dance forms.
Another basic motive of dance is the expression and communication of emotion. People often dance as a way of releasing powerful feelings, such as sudden accesses of high spirits, joy, impatience or anger. This emotional expression way can be seen not only in individual dances but also in the more formalized and collective dances such as tribal war dances or festive folk dances. This motive also plays an important role in any culture.

In some societies dances may be the only events at which young people of different sexes can meet. In contemporary society, dances also provide important occasions for young people to socialize.

My country inhabitants called it ""Martisor"". In spring, people give each other a gift of a white and red piece of string, which means revival of the environment.
One of my reasons is that this custom is symbol of life and health. In our competitive world, when we often forget to enjoy the simplest things in our life such as flowers, trees, fresh air, walking with friends and family, or in other words have a good time, ""Martisor"" is not a simple gift. Our life is very complicated and stressful. Therefore, in my opinion, this custom will benefit to all people all over the world.
Another important reason is that one can make a lot of friends by giving them his inexpensive gift. Also, he can make it by himself because it is very easy to make and you do not need special acknowledge how to make it. For example, I feel very happy when somebody gives me such a gift. This is not because I like surprises. When somebody give you a gift, this means he is proud of you, he love you, or even he want to make you happy, to see your smile or a look in your eyes.
In conclusion, I can say that if I had an opportunity to choose one custom, I would select ""Martisor"" because everybody can make a lot of friends enjoying life and having a good time by giving them this symbol of life and health.

One of them is the satisfaction of the worker. No matter what other people say, if the person is satisfied with his/her work, that's it. For example, my father was a good student in high school. His parents and teachers told him to go to law school because it was the best career a person could have at that time and was an honor for the family. But my father disagreed and went to the army because he wanted to. And until now, he is very satisfied with his job. He didn't choose a job that was conspicuous to other people, but a job he liked.
Another factor is how well the job suits the person. We can't get a clumsy person to be a doctor that requires great awareness on the work, such as surgery. A single mistake, even the slightest failure can kill a person. So people should also consider on how well he/she can do the job, and if it's suiting the person.
In closing, I disagree with the idea of money being the most important aspect of a job. Of course, we can't totally ignore money. Usually many people just work, whether they like it or not, just to earn money. But we must keep in mind that money should be considered as a second, after we decide things such as the satisfaction or how well the job suits the person.

First, technological learning is more interactive in its learning process than just sitting and reading a book or just listening to a lecture. For example the learning by the means of Computer technology is very interactive, today, and hence the growth is simultaneous.
Second, using such kind of techniques, mind actually grows more and the person becomes an intellectual person with the passage of time.
Third, the traditional methods of learning like lectures given by teachers or notes given in books. Do not let the student become independent rather the student becomes more dependent due to the spoon-feeding being done to it.
Fourth, the technological advances in different fields definitely give a lot of exposure to those who were earlier naive in this field of Technology.
Lastly, human mind is such that it has the capacity to absorb more data if things are taught to him practically. Like if there is a model of an Electric Iron shown in the Book, which is explained by the teacher and the students are made to understand the working. The other way could be this that the children are shown a real Electric Iron as a model and then the working of its different parts is being explained. Definitely the grasping power will be more in the latter case.

69.txt,"If I were an employer, I would hire a worker depending upon the type of the work my organization deals with. There are many types of organizations that deal with different works like industry, restaurants, consultancy, banks, forum etc. And depending upon these types of organizations, the working personal also varies. If I belong to the organization that works for building and construction, and I require workers for the same purpose, then I would surely hire inexperienced workers at a lower salary. By doing this I will make my organization more cost effective, as for building and construction purpose, more numbers of workers are required, and this helps cutting down expenses. Also, when the work is related to the physical work, then more than experience, the desire to work counts. If the person is inexperienced, then he can learn how to work, until he has desired to work. But, if the organization is related to the professional levels, then in such case, experienced workers are highly required. So, the type of the work is directly related to requirement of the experienced or inexperienced worker with respect to the amount of the salary. As I am related with the international organization, I would prefer an experienced worker even at a higher salary.
Experience is the most important criteria for getting professional job. Experience makes the person perfect. And perfect ones can only work effectively and efficiently by the time they join the organization. Even for the experienced person, it takes some time to understand the way the organization works and the management over there. So, for the inexperienced person, it takes almost months to years to know the working atmosphere of the organization depending upon the type of work. The total amount of the salary the worker gets by the completion of work is almost same whether the worker is experienced or inexperienced. Training is required for an inexperienced worker and the training expenses can be more. But for the experienced worker, training is not required, one can just understand by observing, and managing oneself. The experienced one can get the job done soon while, the inexperienced worker takes double the time. Double the time means double the salary one gets. So, whether one is experienced or not, total amount of the salary, the employer has to pay is somewhat equivalent. Organization values its overall human resources, no matter whomever; all are integral part for its existence. For the long-term development and for the Excellency, experienced worker needs to be hired.

Firstly, face-to-face dialogue affords the speaker the opportunity to convey his message in a more detailed and complete way. Emotions, moods and expressions come forth to the surface in a face-to-face interaction, unlike written words or those spoken on the telephone. By using tone, facial gestures and body language, the speaker gives a thorough idea of the listener of his point of view. For example, by leaning forward on his chair, opening his arms and moving his hands in a forceful manner, the speaker can convey interest and leadership.
Another benefit that face-to-face communication provides is immediate feedback. The speaker can clarify any confusion right away. Unlike written statements, no idea or thought is lost in grammatical errors or misuse of vocabulary. Since all people involved in the conversation can easily see each other, approval, interest, or disregard, can easily be deduced and dealt with.
Often we see messages getting confused, and warped up in a maze of paperwork or unanswered e-mail and telephone calls.

More than even the professional teachers that we have in school, parents are generally the most involved in the development and education of children.
Almost for sure our parents are the best teachers at the beginning of our lives, which actually corresponds to the parents' role in nature. Parents are most committed and involved in teaching their children; they have a kind of instinct to sacrifice a part of themselves for the betterment of their children. They love us and have great patience while passing down their knowledge to us. They wish us a success and thus will not teach us bad things. And of course, implicit learning occurs when children unconsciously copy some of their parents' habits and styles of behavior.
During the second stage of child development, adolescence, parents can still be in the best position to offer advice even though the children might not accept it. In this case, perhaps the child's friends would be the best teachers. Adolescents are notoriously rebellious in many cultures and may automatically reject any advice from their parents. My first marriage for instance, was solely a matter of doing the opposite when my parents tried to intrude in offering their advice. So in such matters, parents should be much more flexible and be rather the partners with their children. So we can see that being a teacher of growing child become more and more complicated case as the time passes and many parents are simply not able to meet the increased demands.
On the other hand, I would say that parents are not professional teachers and they tend to be very biased by their love of their children. So wishing good things and an easy life may prevent children from maturation. In any case, parents usually can present only one viewpoint of the world, while good teaching should be based on different attitudes. Thus, when children go to school and have a great diversity of teachers, they learn much more than their parents could probably give them. Furthermore, once our parents get older, they become more conservative and cannot always be objective in regard to modern trends and fashions. Thus we need to take their advice with caution during that period. However, some kind of intuition, which I believe, shared between relatives about what everybody needs and great love, which exists in families, still makes our parents very good teachers and advisers at any time.

In the final analysis, I prefer the latter one to the former one. In the following discussion, I would like to have evidence to support my view.
First of all, the disadvantage of attending separate schools is that the mutual sex will be suffering in the future because of lacking the knowledge about the opposite sex. One of my friends, for example, who was in separate high schools, lost the regular psychological mind after breaking up with her first boy friend. Because she didn’t know boys very well, she hoped they could get along well as the relationship between she and her girlfriends. However, her boyfriend didn’t do as what her girlfriends did such as going shopping for a whole day. She was disappointed by him and had an extremely terrible fight with him. They broke up in the end. She was hurt so deeply that couldn’t control her behavior any more.
Second of the place, the advantage of attending mixture schools is that boys and girls can help each other more efficient than those in separate schools. Because of different physical minds, they have different ways to think about questions. When they communicate together, they exactly can get some new ideas from others. I still remember after discussing with my partner who was a smart guy, I learned to consider the same thing with different ways. In this case, I really benefit from those experiences to work out every possibility in my work.
However, it may be true that in the mixed schools students will be affected by falling love so early. But the thing is when girls from separate schools meet strangers they are much easier be attracted by opposite sex than those from mixed schools. So this alone can’t constitute sufficient support to the view that boys and girls should attend separate schools.
Given the reasons discussed above, the conclusion, which may intertwine at the beginning of discussion and thus become more persuasive, may be safely reached that it’s not necessary for boys and girls to attend separate schools.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN
86.txt,"Internet as we all know is changing the way we live our lives in the new millennium. Never before in the history of mankind, was so much information available to people. So with this abundance of information, also come the clashes of views. Some people believe that this medium provides people with lot of information, while others stand by the view that this excess of information creates problems. In my opinion, the information provided by the Internet is valuable to people and can help us solve a lot of problems which is faced by the world today. It can also serve as people voice against corrupt governments and make them aware of their rights to freedom and expression of free speech.
Internet because of its distributed nature is very free in nature. By free, I mean that anyone and everyone with a view can express it on the Internet. This is best described by the journalists and other social workers that can break the news of war, conflict or any epidemic almost immediately as it occurs. Previously, governments used to control the flow of information. But now due to the advent of the Internet, every piece of news and developments in news stories can be broadcasted live over the Internet. This valuable information is transmitted over the Internet over a medium, which knows no limits or boundaries. This helps in bringing people closer and promises that the message will be delivered to the world in an uncensored form. This principle very much supports the view that this is a free world, which is made possible due to the medium of Internet.
Another nature of the Internet is that, it is non- proprietary and no one can claim ownership or copyright over it. This establishes an ideal medium for people to exhibit their work. Best examples of these are the students at university, music artists, scientists researching on a new product or path-breaking discovery. With so much information freely available, people can be well informed of their alternatives available to them. Like for example, I read in a news article that a woman in Africa was suffering from a rare form of cancer. The doctors in Africa had given up hope. Then one of the doctors had read over the Internet about a new revolutionary treatment for this cancer being developed by some Canadian doctors. So after some more research and communication over the Internet with the Canadian team of doctors, the women were flown to Canada, where she was treated for the cancer. Thus, a life was saved because information was available in time.
So I believe that Internet provides people with a lot of valuable information, which in most cases is life saving or sometimes is educating to people. But I would also like to add that with this access of information comes responsibility. So individuals and governments should respect the value of information and use it in ethical ways so as not to cause damage.",0.9993,0.0007,HUMAN

Mr. Steve Harvey is a comedian. He makes the people laugh. Watching his shows makes the audience tension-free. This would have a soothing effect on our hearts and brains. For instance, if somebody has a heart disease, he can feel good by laughing which watching his shows can do. Also some angry people can reduce their anger by watching his shows.
He is a very sober actor. It means that he never appreciates vulgarity. We can watch his shows with our family and enjoy them. Now days, children are getting spoiled by watching TV. This is because TV encourages vulgarity.
Secondly, he speaks very good English. A foreigner can learn American accent by watching his shows. We can improve our vocabulary simply by enjoying simultaneously. And it’s very good for language learning children.

151.txt,"According to me an animal could be considered important based on what it contributes to mankind. In India the most important animal is the Cow. It is important as it provides a source of food to people, it is an animal, which can be used for labor, and also the Indian people religiously worship the cow.
Majority of the people in India are Hindus. According to Hindu beliefs and customs, the cow is religiously worshiped. Temples are built in respect of the animal, and the animal itself is considered holy. These animals are allowed to wander freely anywhere they please, whether it be on the farmlands and fields, or the city streets. In Mumbai and other metropolitan cities of India one would find many cows roaming on the streets. People will very often buy grass and hay, to feed the animals. Although they do cause hindrance to vehicular traffic, but people would never harm them. Car drivers would patiently wait for a cow to move off the center of the road, without honking. Their horns or doing anything to scare the animal. This is because of the fact that they worship the animal, and they feel that the animal is important. According to the Hindu religion the god Shri Krishan happened to also be a cow herder, and hence the cow is also worshiped.
In India the main source of milk, happens to be the cow. Every day, dairies all over India supply several million liters of milk. They happen to be the cheapest supply of milk for the people, without which tens of thousands of babies would go unnourished. Thousands of verities of dairy products and sweets are made from fresh cows milk. Without the cow this would not be possible. Hence the animal is of prime importance to the nation. Also apart from milk, the cow also happens to be the main source of meat in the country. Beef is widely consumed throughout the country. The Muslim community, which happens to be the second largest community in India, are forbidden by religion to consume pork or any other form of pig meat. For them and for other communities also, the cow happens to be the only source of meat, as goats and sheep are not reared in as large numbers and are not found as abundantly as the cow is.
Apart form being a source of meat, the cow is also used on farms for plowing the fields, and for pulling the bullock carts. In India the farmlands are not consolidated, and hence are very often divided among family members. This makes the size of the farm plots very small. Also most farmers are not very wealthy. Due to these reasons automation is not feasible. Hence for plowing the fields, for carrying the grains etc cows are employed on the farms. Cows are also considered as very docile and tamed, and loving animals, which can easily be used as animals of burden.
For the Indian people, the cow is not just as an animal of worship, but also a source of food and milk. It is also a very useful animal of burden and can be tamed easily. Hence it has gained the most importance in India.",0.9993,0.0007,HUMAN
93.txt,"If I could ask a famous person one question, it would definitely be regarding the meaning of life to him/her. The meaning of life has long puzzled even the greatest of minds. In my opinion, knowing the meaning of life and what one wants out of life can actually help a person to live out a fairly productive life.
Life represents different things to various people. Some people view life as mesmerizing and worth living, while others just take it for granted and don't really give it much thought. Knowing what life is really about is of great importance to me. I have always been amazed at the multitude of living beings that presently inhabit the earth. What is the meaning of life? How did it come about in the first place? What can be done to make living here on earth worthwhile? Someone who is famous might actually have some interesting thoughts to share on this subject.
It surprises me that no one ever asks such questions from famous people. People like to interview a famous person and ask all sorts of personal questions. I think that asking this single question and carefully observing the speaker can actually reveal a lot about the speaker's personality and outlook than asking personal questions. This is because famous people might become somewhat defensive and not entirely honest when asked to describe their personality traits or likes/dislikes. But asking them about their outlook about life gives them space to talk about a lot more than just answering some to-the-point questions.
Asking a famous person about his/her view about life might also help us out in how we can view the world around us. Often people who become famous or successful have positive outlook towards present and future. They don't worry about the hardships of the past. This might motivate others to adopt a similar positive view of life.

The very first reason to suggest a place like this instead of stunning, scenic beautiful natural places is that everywhere in this world, we can relax ourselves by visiting a naturally beautiful, peaceful place. But ""The Banyan"" is a place where mentally ill disputed, forsaken women get shelter.
The reason why I was very much impressed by ""The Banyan"" is, It is the perfect rehabilitation center, found by two college girls Vandhana and Vaishnavi without any strong political as well as economical background but with their strong fire for helping people. After facing number of problems, they established this organization. Now this organization has hundreds of members.

78.txt,"Language is the best mean of communication. In globalization era, one language is definitely not enough for one to be able to communicate well with foreigner. I strongly support the idea that children should begin learning a foreign language as soon as they start school. They will get themselves familiar with new language, improve hearing ability as the time goes by, and learn to speak new word early.
In my country, Thailand, it is compulsory for all children to start learning English at the age of three or four. However, they learn only a few word like one, two, three and simple animal names. It is more fun to know other languages especially when children begin to learn with very easy vocabulary. The learning process is more fun for them. Most language books for kids are colorful and fun to read. It gets children familiar with new languages without feeling afraid or bore to learn.
No doubt, early start means more time for practice. Children can improve their hearing ability from foreign movie, songs, or from tourists. They might not be able to understand the whole conversation but they will hear the word they have learned and know how to pronounce them correctly. I have read the book about bringing up a child where parents speak two languages; there is no problem for a child to learn two languages at the same time. Psychologist said a child will not get confuse but he will be able to speak two languages which will surely be one asset for the future.
In addition, children would start to say a word or sentence early and do not worry so much about mistake as most adults do. You cannot refuse the fact that adults always concern more about grammar and pronunciation of the new languages. This is one of the big barriers for learning. Adults are afraid and not say at all afterward. Language is a matter of practicing not avoiding. Children will start to say what they learn regardless of rule or grammatical part. And that is the best way to learn language.
To me, children can receive new things fast and their development is always progressing. Time and practice will make them master in new language, which will benefit them when they grow up. All in all, language is an art, which one should learn as early as possible. If one wants to see outcome soon, one must start sooner.

50.txt,"""People will work because they need money to live."" Though I do believe that there are a lot of other reasons for people to work. I will enumerate each of these reasons in the following paragraphs.
According to me, all of us have an inbuilt burning desire to SUCCEED. Success is a combination of professional achievements and then earning money as a result of these. Even if one of these components is missing, one will not derive true pleasure of having succeeded. Thus it is a big chain of events, one enjoys one's work, the moment one's work is not to complete a job but an enjoyment, and one works even harder. More hard work over the long run inevitably leads to professional excellence, which in turn translates in monetary benefits.
Secondly, when a person works hard, he contributes directly or indirectly to society. This feeling that ""I have some worth and am contributing to betterment of society"" is very important for mental happiness. Being an orthopedic surgeon myself, I have experienced this numerous times. If a patient comes to me with a fracture and then goes home walking, the pleasure I derive is phenomenal even if I do not derive substantial monetary benefit from this.
I also want to add that work gives money and in this day and age, even for social work one might want to do, one needs funds. Money thus earned can be given for various charitable causes thus giving a tremendous sense of satisfaction and well-being.
I therefore strongly believe that one of the important reasons that people work is for money for them and for their family, there are many, significantly more important reasons for working and these are the ones, which actually keeps life going.",0.9981,0.0019,HUMAN

For example, some people want to be to go on a further study after they graduate from the college; some people hope to find a good job after their studying in the college and also some people wish to exchange their present situation through studying in the college.

First of all, students can learn new knowledge and experiences from the studying in the college.

With their help, student can learn a lot of useful basic and professional knowledge which is very helpful for their future’ work and study. After they finish their study in the college, students go to work in the society and contribute to the different fields.
Secondly, students can learn how to arrange their own time reasonably. Before their studying in college, their life often arranged by their parents and their study often arranged by their teachers. It is very different for them to live and study in college, because students studying in college have to arrange their life and study by themselves. They have right to arrange their part time, such as when to get up, when is the sport-time, when to finish the assignment etc. This is very important experience for students’ work and life in the future.
Thirdly, studying in the college make students having opportunity to live with other student and learn how to cooperate with other people. Usually, people often have uncomfortable feeling to live with a stranger, because they do not know each other and perhaps their habit and personality are different. But for the long run, it is good for them. They have to cooperate with each other and solve a lot of problems they will face together. Gradually, they can learn how to care and understand other people. It is a preparation for students to go to cooperate with other people in the society.

52.txt,"There are many people around who prefer to do the same things all the time .In my opinion they keep on doing the same things just because they don’t want to take any risks. But there are also people who would like to do different things and take risks. I think I belong to the second category would to explain in this essay why I'd like to do new, different things.
First of all I think that all people should improve themselves and don't give up even if they fail sometimes. The world is changing, and because of the advanced technology we should always read and learn new things. We can't go on with the things we already know, that are why most of the companies arrange courses for their employees, for example courses for computer using or foreign language speaking.
It is easy to do the same ordinary things all the time because you don't have to take any risks and so you can do your work quickly and perfectly. But this changes our lives into a monotone form. In a government building, most of us see workers chatting with each other and making long telephone calls on the phone. I think the reason why they act this way is because they do the same thing all the time and so they finish their work quickly and spend the rest of their time doing unnecessary things.
One should always improve him by doing new thing and shouldn’t forget that it is never late. People can always make new starts in his life at all ages. A few days ago, I read an article and it was about the new starts of life. One story was about an old sailor who had offered 1,008 different men to start a restaurant business together and all the time the answer had been 'no'. But this man hadn't given up and finally he had gotten the answer 'yes'. If this old sailor, Colonel Sanders, hadn't been so willing to start a new business, we wouldn’t be eating Kentucky Fried Chicken today.
Finally I want to tell you about an exam I took last year in my economy course. The Professor had asked only one question and wanted us to write a four-page essay .The question was 'what's risk'. The student who got the highest mark in the exam hadn't written an essay. She had just left the 3 pages empty and written 'this is risk!!' at the bottom of the 4th page.

I find interesting the complexity of his mind and spirit. He was in conflict with his deep religious feelings, he said that the Bible could not be literally true, and these thoughts also allowed Einstein to discard scientific prejudices. He stated that problems couldn’t be solved at the same level of awareness that created them. His creativity amazes me, after Einstein’s work, space and time would never again be the same.

85.txt,"I agree that modern technology is creating a single world culture because it disseminates knowledge beyond the geographic borders of a location. When people communicate they exchange ideas and feelings. In the ancient era, culture was passed from parents to children by spoken language. Knowledge, traditions and beliefs were transferred to the youngest through speaking and in some cases writing or drawing. Thus, at that time, culture was very restricted to the tribe, village or the community were they lived.
The modern means of transportation, in my opinion, was the first invention that contributed strongly to the spread of cultures throughout the planet. The advance of automobiles, airplanes and ships made incredibly easier to be in other parts of the planet. People started to know more about other cultures and many times introducing to their own culture things learned in other places and countries. The exchange of knowledge and goods started to play an important role in people’s life. The café from Brazil, the scotch from Scotland, the cigars from Cuba, the wine from France, the American music, are good examples of how other countries products are rooted in our day-by-day life and our culture.
Furthermore, in the past few years we have experienced a new wave of technology. Internet, mobile phones, email, e-commerce, are some words that resume what is present in our quotidian. As never before was so easy to communicate to one another. Consequently the world is creating a whole new definition of culture. It is the culture of mass that transcends the geographical borders, permitting that you feel at home anywhere in the planet. The people’s behavior and architecture has been standardized either. Picture yourself, for instance, in a hotel room in Japan, Rio de Janeiro or New York. In most cases you will receive the same treatment in all those places and the interior designs all look the same, as the services provided. The reason they do this is to make everyone fell as he was in his own hometown, not mattering where you are from.
In conclusion, modern technology has facilitated our lives enormously. But the price paid for the advancement of technology is that some countries, if they do not stand hard at their beliefs and traditions, they will lose their identity to absorb the globalize culture.

152.txt,"Plants are vital to the survival of all life on Earth--plants transform the light of the sun into energy that is usable to other life on Earth. Without plants, animals would not be able to use the energy of the Sun that reaches the Earth. The removal of one plant from the ecosystem can cause many unforeseen changes, sometimes irreversibly damaging an ecosystem. However, some plants are more important than others, either for biological or cultural reasons. In my country, Korea, I would say that the grass that produces rice has come to be the most important plant, not just because rice is a staple food, but also for other cultural reasons. Virtually every Korean eats rice at least twice a day. I, for example, had rice at breakfast, lunch, and dinner yesterday. For most Koreans, rice is an integral part of a meal, as expected in a meal as ink is to a pen or wheels are to a car--a meal without rice is not a meal. In fact, if I have dinner with my American friends and do not eat rice, I actually feel hungry even if I have filled myself with potatoes or other food while eating with them. Many of my friends have made similar comments to me. So, I believe that rice is as much a part of our daily lives as work or talking on the telephone is.
However, rice is much more than just a staple food to most Koreans--it represents the very sustenance of much of our culture. Our history teachers tell us that the development of rice as an agricultural product was largely responsible for the advancement of Korean culture--since rice was portable and had a long storage time, people had more freedom to move and were less susceptible to changes in the weather. In many ways, rice has come to be considered the perfect food, so ingrained is it in the minds of many Koreans, and many Asians for that matter, as food that we often say, ""have you had your rice"" instead of saying "" have you had your meal."" In fact, I have made this translation error many times while I have been in the United States. I have wanted to ask my American friends whether they have eaten, and I ask, ""Have you eaten your rice?"" Naturally, they often respond ""no,"" leading to much miscommunication. For me, then, rice is more than just food--it is the very sustenance of most Koreans.
In short, rice is by far the most important plant in Korea. Were it removed from Korean society, Korea would change drastically; perhaps even have a famine much like the Irish Potato Famine of the 1800's. Rice is the very lifeblood of Korea.",0.9986,0.0014,HUMAN
84.txt,"Advertising is an all-powerful tool in today’s world where communication means are varied and accessible by all, and reaching the target audience with the right message makes all the difference. Advertising is a medium through which, people can be educated about a particular issue at hand. Advertising can be about a new product, a new business opportunity or in this case about a country. I strongly agree with the statement that advertising can inform, educate and can tell a lot about the country. I will support my argument through examples and reasoning given below.
Advertising can be of many forms: Printed and published information, through broadcast media (radio and television) and now the most important emerging means of all; that of the Internet. All these forms of advertising have their own advantages and disadvantages. Advertising is generally responsible for the first impressions of a country in people's minds. In this case, what they hear about a particular country for the first time through any means of advertising, will result in it being a true picture of a country for that person / country.
So that's the reasons why governments of some developed countries have taken this issue of projecting the right image of their country through advertising very seriously. This is proven by the fact that their tourism numbers and advantages of living and working in their country are most highlighted than other countries. This is nonetheless important in today’s competitive global environment where countries are competing against each other to attract new investments and business in their country. All this directly affects the economic and development scene of the country as good or bad advertising can directly result in the country's growth.
For instance, in my country India, the Information technology ministry has spent substantial finances and efforts to highlight India's advantage as a global source for information technology workers. This in fact has resulted in growth in the Gross Domestic Product of our country there by raising the standard of people living in this country and giving ancient industry a chance to grow in a free capital environment. This couldn’t have been achieved without concentrated advertising of our advantages and economic benefits of developing software in India.
So I conclude to say that Advertising cannot only tell a lot about a country but can also result in bring growth to the economy and prosperity to its people. Adding to that, I would like every government of the world taking efforts to promote the best their county has to give to the world, here by promoting peace and prosperity among all nations.",0.9998,0.0002,HUMAN

In this way, I could see his or her reaction to what I say and thus it is easier to talk. Actually, this is the reason why people prefer to talk in person rather than using a telephone.
The other popular way to communicate is via sending e-mails. This, according to me, is the least personal way for communicating and the hardest way, as well. When we send an e-mail we sometimes either have not seen this person, or we do not know anything about him. Therefore, we cannot easily choose what to write him. Another thing that makes this kind of communication so impersonal is the e-mails, which are sent when we became members to an Internet site. These e-mails are sent to every member and text is the same.

However, human beings being mortal and their powers being limited, no one can predict the future with a very high degree of accuracy. Thus arises the necessity of making predictions and taking risks. There may be times when we are faced with multiple alternatives none of which are perfectly favorable - we have to make a guess and perhaps hope for the best.
In our country, we are required to qualify in a competitive examination in order to get admitted into an Engineering College. The first time I sat for this examination, I failed miserably. I had to get admitted into a General college with Physics as my major. I then decided to go for the technical colleges a second time. I did it and did it well. In my Physics course, however, I barely managed to pass through into the second year. It was a great risk. I could have failed in the competitive examination the second time too. I could have fell sick on the day of the examination. I could have got into a big trouble. In fact, some of my friends who took the same examination with me failed the second time too and are now passing through hard times.
So, there cannot be any golden rule to success. It's a recipe with a bowl of planning and perhaps one or two spoonful of risks. The exact proportions depend largely on the individual concerned and the situation. Those who can identify the correct proportions come out with flying colors; others fade into the millions. God has not given us the power to predict the future, but he has surely equipped all of us to be able to measure the pros and cons. We are all capable of taking calculated risks and that's what is required. How much calculation and how much risk. Well, no golden rule!",0.9995,0.0005,HUMAN
20.txt,"All means of transportation should be kept in good conditions. However, I believe it would be most beneficial for a country or city, if its government spent more money on improving public transportation. This would result in substantial standard of living improvements.
The volume of cars and trucks hitting the highways is dramatically rising every year. As a result, the number of traffic jams, accidents and carbon monoxide emissions are doing too. All these factors have a detrimental effect on our quality of life. Expanding subway lines and railroads and developing an effective plan to combine buses and subways routes, would eventually lead to a reduction in pollution levels, less traffic jams and less stress for the people.
If subway lines reached every corner of a city, people would not need to use their cars to commute. Less cars on the road, means less carbon monoxide emissions into the atmosphere; therefore, the air we breathe would be more pure. Less cars also means less traffic jams, which translates into less stress for drivers and better living conditions.
Not every country has a well-developed railroad system. Consequently, they have to rely on trucks and buses for ground transportation of passengers and freight. Expanding and upgrading railroad systems will result in fewer trucks and buses on the highways. Removing this kind of traffic from the highways and encouraging the use of trains, would be another way to reduce congestion on the freeways. The reduction of traffic represents less maintenance costs for the government. This surplus of money could be use for other purposes. For example, a forest recovery program or a national campaign against pollution.
Highways, roads and public transportation all require maintenance funds, but I think it is more important to think about the future and how to make our countries or cities better places to live in. Improving public transportation will help reduce traffic jams, accidents and air pollution. A safer, healthier and more enjoyable place to live waits for us in the future.",0.9962,0.0038,HUMAN
121.txt,"People behave differently when they wear different clothes. Clothes certainly do have an influence on the behavior of the people. I strongly agree with this idea because I myself have seen practical examples from daily life.
Everyday we see people wearing all sorts of clothes. Many people wear different kind of clothes for different occasions. For example, formal clothes are generally worn for interviews, seminars, official meetings, and most of the places its a dress code for the employees. People are supposed to behave formally in formal dress. It implies that the man or woman in the formal dress has proper manners, behaves gently and carries high standards. Anybody wearing the formals acts to represent the glory of the dress. It is expected out of him/her to behave decently and carry high standards. No matter if that person is not capable of representing the code of dress, but when he/she is wearing the dress, the feeling comes alive to him/her and the result is what we see as the their behavior being different in that particular dress.
Same is true for informal or casuals as it is popularly known as. People like to be casual and carefree when they are inside an informal dress. The casual dress brings a feeling of fun and enjoyment with it. It let people to enjoy, play around and to be free from all the mundane Activities. No one can notice the artificial act of a person when he/she is in casuals. People also know that they are not supposed to be what they are not inside a casual.
Let us take another example of occasions where the dress code commands people. Talk of marriages and festivals and the whole picture becomes clear in mind. One can see the bride carrying that beautiful smile mixed with shyness, not only because of occasion, but also because of the dress. She knows that she is wearing the dress, which every girl aspires for, and she knows how she has to act when she wears it. It is applicable for the groom. He carries the dignity and charm with him because he knows that when he is wearing the wedding clothes, he has to act accordingly. He cannot act in the same way as he does when he is wearing casuals or formals.
People get ready for festivals not only with great enthusiasm and anxiety, but also with their special dresses. In many countries there is a dress code for different festivals. People are supposed to wear it and when they are inside that special dress, they have to be out of them and act as a person who best represents the dress. One can easily see the joy and charm on a person's face when he/she wears those special dresses. After all that is what is expected out of them when they wear it.
Different dress codes have been designed with the idea of making people act differently. The dress controls the person inside it. Hence I certainly feel that dress dictates the behavior of a person wearing it.",0.9993,0.0007,HUMAN
109.txt,"Some people believe that a college or a university should be available to all students. Others think that higher education should be available only to good students. In my opinion, higher education should be available to all students. Why do I think so?
Firstly, to get higher education is a right of any person. If higher education is available only to good student, it will be infringement of human rights. We cannot say to man that she or he is not entitled to get higher education because it will be anti-constitutional. On the other hand, a college or university can have own rules for students who don't have a good GPA. For example, students can graduate from college if they have only ""A"" or ""B"". Another example, students can take several times the same exam while they won’t receive a good grade. It is very important to give a right to get higher education to all students, because it will be their chance to change something in their life, get better job in the future or built their career.
Secondly, who gives us right to share people in good and bad students. Maybe they have good abilities for studying, yet, these students chose the wrong way ignoring learning when they were high school students. We have a lot of examples when people didn't have a good grade when they were a high school students, however, they could graduate from college and became to work successfully. We know many examples about great people, Pushkin, Mendeleev, who weren't good students in all subjects, but they were very talented persons and whole world knows their names. To be a good or bad students are not the same to have abilities for learning. We should understand and remember it.
Some people can say that government and parents just waste money for education bad students. Nonetheless, the government also can change rules for those students. For example, not support financially if the student has a grade ""C"" or worse. However, our government sustains any students. I think that it is the right way, because we live in a free country and any man has the same right to get higher education. In summary, in spite of colleges and universities are mostly interested in good students, I strongly believe that any students, good or bad, should have the same right to earn high education.",0.9998,0.0002,HUMAN
108.txt,"If I had to travel to a place 40 miles away, I would consider several ways of transportation, such as car, bicycle, or train. Each of these options has its advantages and disadvantages. In this essay I will present advantages of each way of traveling, and I will argue in favor of traveling by train.
It would be possible to travel by car. Cars are reasonably fast and comfortable. They can accommodate more than one passenger, which is important when several people travel together. Most cars are spacious, so every passenger has enough space to fully enjoy the trip. Moreover, passengers can travel as fast as it suits them. If they are in hurry or some kind of emergency situation, they can travel very quickly. On the other hand, if the purpose of their trip is casual, such as visit to a friend or having a picnic in the nature, they can make occasional stops, in order to rest or enjoy the pleasant surroundings. The driver requires some mental effort, because he has to pay attention to the traffic in front of him.
Another option is traveling by bicycle, since 40 miles is not a very large distance. One important advantage of a bicycle is that it doesn't burn fuel in order to move, so it doesn't produce toxic output, which would pollute the environment. Moreover, bicycles are healthier than cars. Riding a bicycle requires physical effort and strengthens muscles. In fact, some scientist asserts that riding a bicycle is one of the most effective forms of exercise. Bicycles find their way through heavy traffic more quickly and easily than cars. Also, they use less space and are easier to park, which makes them useful for travels through heavily urbanized and crowded areas. Finally, bicycles are the cheapest conveyances, since they don't require expenses for fuel, and only minute amounts of money are needed for maintenance.
For my part, I must argue in favor of traveling by train, because it comprises some of the main positive properties of both previously discussed approaches. Trains are very comfortable, and they don't require any effort from the passenger, neither physical, nor mental. They are also very fast, sometimes even faster than cars. Finally, trains are environmentally clean means of transportation, since they use electric power, not fossil fuels, like cars do. The superiority of traveling by train is further confirmed by the corresponding price, which is significantly higher than those of car or a bicycle travels.",0.994,0.006,HUMAN
120.txt,"I believe that life is a river, every destination with a unique purpose. Change is but a minor part of life and whatever the change, mine would be for the better.
People vary and that is why you often find various approaches to life. For those who are content with the direction their life is heading, the idea of change would probably send shivers through them. This is due to the fact that they are at a point where they are satisfied with the way they have maximized their God given potential that is a positive reason for dreading change.
Others dread change due to the fact that they are too scared to try or adapt to new experiences. Taking into consideration that we are all human, fear to try is a normal feeling. The only disadvantage is the fact that unless you try, you never know what you could have accomplished or how well and capable you are to move on. No chances to discover the courage you have within to accept defeat but never stop trying. This is a negative reason for dreading change.
Habits can be addictive and so the main question here is whether they are positive beneficial habits or negative ones. By that I mean that the choice is all up to the individual. If the change is from the negative to the positive, then there is no reason whatsoever that should make one dread change Doing right is never wrong.
In conclusion, change can either mould you or break you. I would rather try and change for the better than life my life knowing that I never tried. Within every human being, there is a hidden potential that only change can help maximize. The question however is, whether we will give change a chance.

134.txt,"The issue that children should help with household tasks is one that is open to debate. On the one hand, some people think that children should not be required to help if there is not need for them to do part of the household tasks. Some people also say that is preferable for children to devote more time to playing, reading and watching interest things on TV. On the other hand other people support the idea of teaching children household tasks and make them help at home. I adhere to the latter point of view. I base my opinion on the following points.
First, helping in our houses when we are children teaches us of the ways of doing household tasks. This might be very useful in our future, even if we can hire someone to do those things for us. I have three sisters and my mom always explained to us how to cook, clean or iron our clothes. We also had a maid to help us with most of the chores, but anyway my mom wanted us to learn. It is well known that is very difficult to correct the job of someone else if you don’t know the job yourself. Thanks to this learning, I can now handle many of my houses tasks, and when my maid cannot come to my house I anyway manage to go to work with my clothes clean or ironed. Moreover, it helped me grow by learning that all of us have responsibilities at home, even if it is a minor one such as preparing toasts for breakfast.
Second, doing the household tasks helps you be more tolerant with others, put yourself in their situation and understand them more. Before I practiced this kind of tasks at home, I usually though that keeping a house clean and tidy was a very simple and minor issue. Now, I don’t. I’ve learnt to appreciate how energy consuming doing the household can be and how many things need to be done before we arrive at home and see everything in perfect conditions. This has helped me grow as a more considerate person. I value the job of those who work for me. I’ve felt how boring and exhausting cleaning a house can be, and I try to recognize through a fair pay this job.
Third, I believe that you can learn household activities and help at home without resigning to other activities. When I was a child I helped my mom with part of the chores, but however had plenty of time to read and play with my friends. Doing part of the household did not affect either my academic performance or my social activities. Hence, as my sisters and I helped at home, my mom could also have a personal life and spend more time playing with us.
To sum up, I believe that is a good idea to make children help with some of the household tasks even if there is no need to do so because someone else can handle it. In my opinion, doing part of the household promotes children to grow and mature as responsible and considerate people, and does not affect their academic or personal life.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN
21.txt,"I was born in a small, quiet and peaceful village. Like other children in the village, I hope that one day I will live in a big city. Because I think that it is better for children to grow up in a big city than in the countryside. There are many advantages when living in a big city.
Firstly, the infrastructure in big city is much better than in the countryside, so the life there is more convenient. There are many highways and long, big bridges, which make transportation easier. With so may transport means such as taxi, family car, bus, cycle... it is very easy for you to go anywhere at any time. Along busy streets are tall, beautiful buildings. They are hotels, restaurants, embassies, hospitals, schools, private village big schools, big hospitals equipped with modern facilities make the study and treating disease more effective. Living in big cities, children have good opportunities to learn in good schools and examine in good hospitals. In entertainment centre, there are many games to develop children' body including physical games and intellectual ones. Children can play there after hard periods in class. In big cities, telecommunications are also completed. Children can access with new technology easily. It's wonderful to live in big city. That's reason why I wanted to stay in my uncle's house in Hanoi, capital of Vietnam, when I visited her at the children' age.
Secondly, big cities are not only economic centers but also social, cultural ones of a country. People here are active, polite, and intelligent... They are always busy with their work. It's good for children to get acquainted with people like them. Children can learn more from life in big cities than in the countryside. The life is hard and difficult, so it's good to adapt to it when you are children. The life in city helps children to have beautiful dream and have chance to make these dream come true.
Although there are also disadvantages in big cities such as social evils, environmental pollution, and noise... living in big cities is still dream of many people. It is better for children to grow up in big cities and have weekends in the countryside enjoying fresh air than live in the countryside and rarely come to city. In brief, children can develop comprehensively when living in big city.

35.txt,"There are many advantages and disadvantages to offering employees job security for life. In Japan, for example, prospective employees know that their employers will provide them with job security for their entire working days and they are better able to plan for their future and family. However, many businesses are now realizing that their employees have less motivation to work and this leads to less profit for the company. I will describe the advantages and disadvantages of this system in this essay and I will show that ultimately “jobs for life” is not good for a society.
Job security is very important for both the employee and the employer. For the employee, job security is important because she can depend on her source of income and better plan her future accordingly. For the employer, the employee represents an investment because of the number of hours of training required and the company will continue to have a return on this investment. As we all know, feeling secure about where our future income will come from is very important for our well-being—anybody who has lost a job and has had trouble finding a new one knows that this transition period can cause a lot of anxiety.
However, job security tends to lead to decreased productivity. In general, employees who are certain that they can never lose their jobs tend to work less efficiently, thereby contributing to an overall reduction of productivity in the company. A common example all over the world is that of civil servants. In Thailand, for example, many government workers are so indolent that it can take days or months for something to be finished that should only take a few days. It is not uncommon to walk into a government office and see employees filing their nails, making personal calls on the telephone, taking three-hour lunches, or surfing the Internet for fun.
Finally, the model of capitalism is proving to be the most efficient model that we have right now. This model of job security completely contradicts the foundations of capitalism. We can see in the United States now that people are starting to change jobs, even careers more and more often. Some career consultants even recommend that employees find new jobs every three to five years. Even in countries that still offer job security for life, this model is showing signs of dying out. For example, in Japan, once famous for its lifelong jobs, both employees and employers are starting to expect that these jobs will not last a lifetime. Many of my Japanese friends travel back and forth between the United States and Japan are have been able to find temporary professional jobs while they are in Japan.
In short, I disagree that companies should offer their employees jobs for life. We can see this example in some parts of the world and in other areas in the United States, but these examples are generally regarded as outmoded ways of conducting business. Finally, the models of capitalism, even though it may seem cruel, the so-called “law of the jungle,” are proving to be the most effective way to raise the standard of living of a country.",0.9982,0.0018,HUMAN

Helping each other’s is really interesting because you will finish fast. When I’m in the office, my partner Rachel brings me help and we both finish in less time I think that without her help, I probably spend hours.

So far, there have been many transportations vehicles such as: automobile, bicycles, and airplanes… When these transportations vehicles were invented, they all make people’s lives change. In these essay, I would like to talk about the way airplanes change people’s lives because among three transportations vehicles: automobiles, bicycles, airplanes, I think airplanes have changed people’s lives the most powerfully.
Firstly, airplanes change the way people move. Before airplanes were invented, people could go on land, on water and dreamed to fly like birds on the sky. The dream came true when the first airplane was produced. Since then, people have been able to fly on the sky, see everything from height. That’s wonderful feelings. Therefore, airplanes are great invention. They have given people new feelings. On the basic of airplanes, people can continue their dream more and more such as: coming to another plane…. Producing airplanes is the first step to approach to long step after that.
Secondly, advantages of airplane make people more comfortable in the life. The speed of airplane is very fast, so people can save time, which is one of the most precious things of each person. It takes a little time to go from one place to another than other transportation vehicles like automobiles, bicycles, and train… In Vietnam, it takes forty-eight hours to come from Hanoi to Ho Chi Mink city by automobile; meanwhile it takes two hours by airplane. Moreover, services of airplane firm are very good. Thus, it is convenient for passenger to choose airplane to go anywhere. Perhaps, airplanes aren’t the safest transportation means, but with long distance, it is better to choose airplane.
Finally, with airplanes, the relationship between people is more and more closer. It is easier to meet cousins in family, friends because going by airplane is very convenient. The special days like New Year, Noel… are gladder because every member in family can attend. The world seems to be smaller. Airplanes connect every part in the world. The distance wasn’t a big problem when airplanes were born. In conclusion, airplanes really change people’s lives. It is evident fact that all the affect of airplanes on people’s lives are good.

122.txt,"I totally disagree with the statement that decisions that people make immediately are always wrong. Some decisions need to be made after careful thought, while some decisions have to be made immediately due to the limit of time.
In the real life, people don't always have enough time to think about what kind of decisions they need to make and how many options they have in order to reach the optimum result. Time does restrain people from making decision after careful of thought. The first case happens in the stock exchange market. The price of stock changes every minute, even every second. The brokers need to make immediate decision to buy or sell. If they spend a long time on making decision, they will lose chance to make a lot of money, the stocks will never be available when they make final decisions. Even though quick decisions might make brokers to lose some money, but there are still 50% chance to make much money. If they don't make a quick decision and miss the chance, they will never make money. So from this case, we can conclude that immediate decisions are not always wrong.
Another case comes from sports. During the soccer game, the team members usually have been assigned duties and given strategies before the game by the coaches. But during the last 5 minutes, two teams have the same score, one of team must win this game so that they are eligible to attend the semi-final, at the same time the coach of this team has no more chance to give his team member more suggestions. Therefore, the team members need to change their old strategies on their own so that they will have chance to win. But if members take more time than 5 minutes to make decision, they might make a best decision, but this best decision won't work at all since time is up. They will absolutely lose the chance to win. However, if they make a quick decision, it is very possible for them to win this game and get into the semi-final.

For most people, they often form an opinion on the people they meet the minute they meet. Their basis for this act is that 'first impression is always right'. Nonetheless, how true is this statement? Humans are complex creatures, thus, it is impossible to dissect them in just one minute. Therefore, though occasionally first impression may be right, most of the time they are not as knowing a person inside out is never an easy process.
Shrek in 'Shrek' quoted ""Just like onions, I have layers"". So true is that remark that each layer is different from the other. Humans are like that too. We have feelings and emotions, which not all of them are displayed in a single day. This in turn making the process of friendship a lengthy one. Therefore, to trust first impressions is obviously a silly act, as human characters are only fully understood only after a certain period of time.
In addition to that, moods also play an important role when we judge a person. Humans, as we all know, have their ups and downs and this often affect their judgment if they are not able to control it. The same goes when judging another person. When the mood is right, we might see everybody around us as saints and angels who really make our day. However, imagine when we had a bad day at work, even the nice considerate waiter might seem pushy.
Nevertheless, there could be another group of people who trust their instincts, and stand by it. These groups might argue that first impressions are based on instincts, and as instincts are subconsciously based on past experience, hence, first impressions are reliable. Their point is arguably true, but can anybody actually determine the amount of experience needed to ensure that the instinct is correct? Surely, nobody can.

36.txt,"Attending a live performance is really more enjoyable than watching the same event on television. As I am very interested in football matches, I have experienced that watching a football match at a stadium is not comparable with watching the same thing on TV. I never forget the first time that I went the stadium and the match is inscribed in my mind. It was an unforgettable event.
At a live performance, you can see everything that is not possible on TV. Cameras zoom on special scenes and you cannot see what is going on the rest of the stage. For example, at a football match, the cameraman always tries to see the ball and its related events. When you are watching a football match on TV you cannot see that a player kicks another one because it is out of stage. But when you are present at the stadium you can easily see it.
On the other hand, you can cheer and boo and even cry in a live performance. A crowd like you has attended the match. All cheer and shout together and it encourage you to take part in their happiness. This is really enjoyable. Imagine you were attending Michael Jackson show then you could dance, whistle and cheer. This was not the case when you were at home. You might be alone because others did not like that specific show or they wanted to study. So you could neither dance nor cheer. You had to sit before T.V and turn down its voice. It is not enjoyable at all.
Another advantage that you achieve by virtue of attending a live performance is that you can have the feeling of participating in the performance. Every thing is live. If it is a football match for instance, then it is as if you were playing yourself. You were part of the match and could sense the kicks of the players on the ball.
Above all advantages, there is only one disadvantage. It is that you must pay money to buy the ticket and spend time to reach the location of the performance. But it does not matter for me.

22.txt,"A greater number of people are now hitting the eighty-year mark than ten years ago. In fact, the life expectancy of the average human has gone up considerably, and is rising still. This phenomenon is the result of several reasons. For one, continuing scientific and medical innovation ensure that more people receive the treatment they require. As our knowledge grows regarding various diseases, we become better equipped to tackle them. Consequently, we have managed to eradicate some diseases on a global scale, while controlling the other diseases, so that the rate of mortality does not reach an alarming height during the outbreak of a disease. The plagues of yore, as well as the more recent plague outbreaks are becoming few and far in between. Such control of diseases means that the general life expectancy has gone up.
Diseases such as cancer, which used to result almost inevitably in death, are now curable, provided they are diagnosed at a certain stage. Diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera now cause fewer deaths than they used to only a few decades ago. Another reason for the greater life expectancy is the general betterment of the quality of life. What we call the ‘global village’ is fast becoming a city. And in this city, more and more people are being provided a better level of hygiene than ever before. A better and improving system of communication ensures that the latest medical discoveries in the United States and Europe are known all over the world in a space of a few days. Therefore, more and more people have access to better health care. Even people living in relatively remote areas have access to some kind of medical facilities. Though these facilities may be incapable of handling a crisis, they may help prevent death in cases that require antibiotics and antivenin, thereby preventing death by infection or poison.
The increase in awareness also means that people in general are becoming more aware of the risks of various diseases. For instance, more people now, than two decades ago, are aware of the scourge of cholesterol and the havoc it wreaks on an individual’s circulatory system. Similarly people are becoming aware that prevention is, after all, better than cure and are taking the appropriate steps to prevent infection from diseases.
In general, though, the increased life expectancy owes much to the revolution in communication. It may be mentioned that even two hundred years ago, inventions and discoveries were being made. However, they did few people any good. It simply took too long to disseminate the information. The general level of awareness regarding health was also low. However, it has been noticed that since the inception of communication through first print, and then radio and television, the level of awareness regarding health has generally risen. To illustrate, print facilitated the spread of knowledge through books. Radio helped bring that knowledge to many people. Television helped to further this knowledge and disseminate is amongst an even greater number of people. And finally, the Internet has removed the final barriers between intercultural and interracial communication. In the coming years, we may hope to see an even greater increase in life expectancy, even as communication techniques continue to improve.",0.997,0.003,HUMAN

On the other hand, it is much more convenient to shop in large shopping center where you can get nearly most of the goods here, from veggies to undergarments, just name it.
Furthermore, the shopping center will most probably benefit the community by offering goods in better price. The shopping center will eventually exist as a main competitor to the other grocery stores and sundry shops in town. Therefore, every store will try to win their customers by lowering the price and at the same time offering better services. And the customer will certainly be the winner in this ‘pricing war’.
In a conclusion, I fully advocate the idea of building a big shopping center in my neighborhood, which will be beneficial to this small town.",0.9999,0.0001,HUMAN

Art and music are considered liberal education. They are the foundation for everything. You can't say directly what good art and music what is the point of education if it does not cultivate us into well-rounded adults? I don't consider education bring. But without the appreciation for art and music nothing accumulates. Music tames the mind, it prepares the soul for the daunting tasks we face each day. Music brings inner peace and keeps our anxiety down. Students must learn in order to appreciate the wonders in music.
Art works in the same way too. Kids ought to be given the opportunity to express themselves other than through speech. Art is the formation of the mind. They draw their minds out. They may find freedom and relieve in it.
It is important that secondary school kids be taught art and music. Art and music are the basis for learning. Other knowledge builds upon it. Moreover, parents sent their children to school with the hope that they excel in the future. Obviously, what our world need are no longer plain bookworms.

132.txt,"Many people believe that a large income equals success. I believe, however, that success is more than how much money you make. Some of those measures of success include fame, respect, and knowledge.
Most people assume that famous people are rich people, but that isn’t always true. For example, someday I would like to be a famous researcher. Few scientists are rich by today’s standards. Still, I will feel myself to be successful if I am well known. Additionally, there are many famous humanitarians who are not so rich. Mother Theresa was one. Certainly, no one would say she was not successful.
I also believe that being respected by co-workers indicates success. Without that, respect, money means little. For example, I once did some work for a top attorney in a law firm. He made a very good salary, but he was not a nice man. No one ever did work for him willingly. He ordered everyone around, and we didn’t respect him. In contrast, however, I had a wonderful band director in high school. He had to take extra jobs just to make enough money to support his family. However, his students had great respect for him and always listened to what he said. As a result, we were a very good band. In my opinion, my band director was more successful than the attorney was.
Finally, I think one of the most important indicators of success is knowledge. Wealthy people don’t know all the answers. For example, in the movie Good Will Hunting, the only person who could solve some complex problems was the janitor. He knew a lot, and decided what he wanted to do with that knowledge rather than just think about money. In my opinion, he was extremely successful.
When we think of history, there few people that we remember simply because they were rich. Overall, we remember people who did something with their lives-they were influential in politics, or contributed to science or art or religion. If history is the ultimate judge of success, then money surely isn’t everything.",1.0,0.0,HUMAN
126.txt,"Some people assert that playing games is important for adults. In my opinion the importance of playing games depends on the types of games considered. While some games may benefit to health, mental abilities, working capacity, or help to relax, others may harm the person playing in different ways.
I think the games that are important for adults to play include those requiring action, intensive thinking and teamwork. It has been medically proven that physical training is extremely important for adults. It helps not only to maintain fitness, but also enhances the capacity of thinking and working. Therefore participating in sports games, such as basketball, football, tennis and other action games is essential. Games that require intensive thinking develop logic, attention and unconventional approach. Among this type of games are puzzles, crosswords, and strategy games. And last, but not least, games that involve team work are important to develop further communicability, ability to make correct decisions with consideration of opinions of different people and other skills, because these skills are often used in everyday situations.
Still there are other types of games that may be harmful. These are lots of computer games, which cause severe eyestrain and exposure to radiation. Moreover, computer games not only harm health, but also have a negative impact on the working capacity. Many companies have stringent rules against their employees playing games during work-hours.
There is also one category of games, which I believe can be both harmful and beneficial. These are games played for money. On one hand, winning such a game the player feels positive emotions, which have an overall positive influence on the players’ health and financial situation. On the other hand, loosing the game can drive the person playing into disappointment and even into depression, thus harming his health, not to mention the loss of money.
Thus, in my opinion, the importance of adults playing games can be evaluated depending on the level of positive or negative influences that those game may have on the person involved.",0.9995,0.0005,HUMAN
27.txt,"Going to the movies is a pleasure for a lot of people and I'm one of those who are really fond of movies. When I heard that a new theater might be built in my neighborhood, I was first very excited about this idea. But after having had a good think about it, I wondered if it was really a good thing. First of all, I will focus on the reasons why I support this idea and secondly, I will move on to analyzing why I oppose this idea.
Over the past 10 years, it's abundantly clear that the seventh art has much changed. Indeed, from special effects to THX sound, we all could have seen the very progresses of the cinema. In spite of that, theaters remain the same and are getting older. As a matter of fact, it begins sometimes difficult for the audience to appreciate a movie at its real value. I mean, not only does the screen is most of the time to small, but the sound is also bad in a lot of theaters. In the case in point, it is bad in the old theater in my neighborhood. Therefore, I would say that it is a pity to see a ""modern"" movie in such conditions.
However, we should not forget that a theater is a place full of remembrances. For instance, a place where year after year, a lot of people have laughed, or shrilled, or cried in front of hundreds of movie, all different. Sometimes, you can see fathers who take their children in the same theater where they used to go twenty years earlier! We should bear all this in mind. So, I am in disagreement with those who think that a theater is just a place made of a screen, walls, and chairs, because it is much more than that. I strongly believe that it is made of remembrances and magic moments too.
All in all, as far as I am concerned, I agree to say that it would be a good idea to build a new theater in order to benefit from more comfort and better conditions. In the meantime, I can't help thinking that what matter most is, above all, all the remembrances kept into old theaters. To put it in a nutshell, I would say that I favor building a new theater, but I will keep on going to the older one.

Kolkata is the city of my birth and no doubt it is my favorite city. Kolkata, like many other metropolitan cities, has a number of features, some of which will really attract newcomers while others will keep them away.
Kolkata is a city that is full of life. Here, unlike any other city in India, people are cooperative and one can enjoy one's joy and happiness in company of others. In Kolkata, help is always available, even if one does not ask for it. This is really a unique feature of Kolkata, which makes it a different city. One can enjoy the festivals to the full extent of one's desire. During the festivals people come closer, even if they are not known to each other. It is the mood during the festivals, which brings all the Kolkata together.
Similarly, people are also available to share each other's sorrow and grief. Here, one will always find a company if he/she searches for solace and comfort. If someone is in distress people are always available to help him/her whatever may be the time of the day. Kolkata is a lively city. One will not feel the live ness of Kolkata unless he or she resides here.
However, in spite of the liveliness of Kolkata, it has some features that may upset a newcomer. One of these is the crowd. The roads here are quite crowded as are the buses on the roads. Its really difficult for a newcomer to get adjusted to these crowded roads. To walk on these roads people have to jostle one another's arms and tramp each other’s feet. There is a great rush on the roads during the peak hours and a lot of traffic congestion. As a result people are always late in reaching their destinations. Here, the number of vehicles passing through the roads is greater in comparison to the number of roads available, which results in traffic congestion.

19.txt,"It's surely not so easy to be a good supervisor because you have to manage so many things and to deal with a lot of people, including your employees. In my opinion, the most important qualities a good supervisor should have are discretion, finesse and impartiality. Since a supervisor is usually responsible for a company, project, or business, etc., he will certainly meet many difficulties and problems and require him to make correct decisions. If a supervisor has not discretion and hesitate to solve the problems, he, of course, can't deal with them well, and he maybe lose some chances of business or cause greater damage because of his hesitation.
Besides discretion, I think a good supervisor should have finesse and impartiality. Usually a supervisor will supervise several employees. It is common there is some conflict of interest among the employees. How to make the employees get along with one another well is a task for a good supervisor. Generally speaking, if a supervisor treats his employees impartially, he can reduce or avoid the conflict of interest among the employees and make them work hard. Jinny was a supervisor in my company, when there was a chance of promotion in her department, she gave the chance to a employee who worked very hard, not to her relative who also worked in her department. All employees said nothing bad about the promotion but respected her.

118.txt,"It may sound strange but my personal approach to learning things is a combination of learning by doing, by reading about things and listening to people talking about them. I consider that using all three ways (when given the opportunity) is the best way to gather as much information as possible about the respective thing.
Sometimes I do not have at hand all three ways of learning so I use whatever is best applicable for that specific case. If, for example, I have to learn about a theoretical subject that I need to use at my work, first I read all available bibliography on that theme, then I try to listen to other people’s opinion on that matter. Combining the two methods, I compare my understanding and possible questions regarding that theme with others comments and approach.
Another case would be when I have to learn a practical thing like playing squash. In this situation the most preferred way to learn is by doing. I would probably ask a trainer to show me how to play. After getting acquainted with the movements I may listen to others talking about their way of playing, in this way trying to use their tips and tricks of becoming a better player.
A case, in which I would combine all three ways mentioned above, is if I have to learn how to use software. Firstly I read instructions and documentation that comes with the software, and then I try to apply what I read. If I have difficulties getting the program to work properly, I ask people with more experience in the matter to show me how to do it, which means I learn by doing. This would also be the case when I learn by listening how others have used the software, what problems they encountered and what solutions they found.
As described above, I consider the best way to learn things is to combine all the methods available for a certain situation and use all information at hand to make the most out the learning process.",0.9998,0.0002,HUMAN
130.txt,"It is difficult to decide whether to build a business research center or an agriculture research center. As for me, I personally prefer to construct the agriculture research center in my country, China. There are two reasons for my position; the agriculture is very important to my country and the less young people like to work in the agriculture.
First of all, the agriculture is very important for my country. The large population cause my country to have the problem that there are still lots of people cannot eat enough food. If we do not improve our country's agriculture technology, it will be hard to resolve the food problem. So building the agriculture research center can offer us more information about the development technology and help us to produce more food. We can learn lots of other developed country's advantages through researching and use this information to advance our country's agriculture. Thus, the agriculture research center can give us many benefits.
Another reason is that the young people begin to ignore the agriculture in my country. They do not like to study agriculture, because they think they cannot earn a lot of money by learning agriculture. The flourishing business attracts them. Especially in villages, everybody wants to work in the city, and nobody care the corps. It causes only the old experts continue to study the agriculture, no new persons can help them to think the problems. The old experts have limited knowledge. They are hard to get the new things. If more young persons can be volunteers to work for agriculture, more problems will be resolved quickly. There, the young people need to realize the importance of agriculture, because they can make more profits in agriculture.
In short, people have different perspectives on building a business center or an agriculture center. However, I am convinced that we need to build the agriculture center. Following my country's situation, the question that whether the people can eat enough or not is the most important things. Therefore, the ignorance of agriculture will make our country go to the famine country.",0.9988,0.0012,HUMAN
124.txt,"""People are never satisfied with what they have; they always want something more or something different."" I would have to agree with that statement entirely. No matter how many goals we have or how many things we own, as human beings we always want more, need more. Our lives would not be full if we weren't that way. The statement above applies to many angles in our lives such as material wants and needs, emotions, the need of achievements and etc'. In this essay I will give different reasons as to why I agree to the above statement, using some of the angles to which it applies.
The dissatisfaction and the permanent need, and want starts in a very young age. Even while we are babies we want this toy, and that doll and no matter how many of them we have we always ask for more. Scientists say that when a baby is given a familiar toy, he will play with it, but after awhile he will get used to it and become less enthusiastic. While on the other hand when a baby is given a new toy, he will have to play with it for a couple of days, he will be very interested until again he will get accustomed to it and a new toy will take its place. Things that we don't own or didn't see before look more attractive to us than the ones that we have.
Once we grow older our goals become a little less material. A daughter or a son might want to get their mother's approval and their father's pride. They may achieve that with high marks and good behavior. Though some children will be in need for attention and do just the opposite. As children or teenagers we all know the feeling of a proud parent, the satisfaction that we feel after we saw a parent's proud smile. That makes us feel happy and right away we want to feel that again. We crave to be successful and happy first and for most for ourselves, and second is to make people, which we love, proud. And through the years that craving becomes stronger and with every goal we accomplish, we reach towards a higher target for the simple reason of feeling needed, taken pride in, and respected. And no matter how many goals we achieve, we will always persist on finding new ones just to accomplish them all over again.
Some people say that a rich person has everything. That is entirely untrue. A rich person might have a very large amount of money, but that only means he has a bigger chance of getting what he wants for money. That doesn't mean that, that person doesn't have any needs or wants beyond objects, which he can buy for money. That person may want to loose wait but never succeeds, or he may want to get that beautiful girl, but she goes only for looks and not for money. For that person the amount of time to be happy may be much longer then yours. The bigger amount of things we have the more amounts of them we want.
In my opinion life will not be worth living without goals. It would be unexciting and that is why we always want something more and something different from what we wanted before. Otherwise all of our goals will be accomplished; imagine your life without any wants or needs, imagine your life when you have everything you ever wanted… I think such life would be very boring and dull. If you have no goals you have nothing to do, you have nothing to want, you have everything. Why would you do something while your life is ""perfect""? The fulfillment will fade away and you will start looking for something different which will bring you to a new goal. Humans cannot live without any ambitions.

125.txt,"Books are an important part of many people's lives in the world today. With such a wide variety of topics that books are written on; they can be broadly classified into fiction and non-fiction. These two types each have their own merits and it would not be fair to only read about 'real events, real people' when there can be so much to learn from imaginary events and people.
Non-fiction has greater practical value in the 'real' world and the information gleaned can be applied intensely at home, at work or in school. Various topics of interest can be researched easily and a greater knowledge level can be obtained. Yet the disadvantage of non-fiction lies in the fact that nothing happens to excite the mind and spirit. In short, many people find these books 'boring' since only facts are provided. However well written the book may be, in the end it leaves little room for the imagination. Consequently this is an area where fiction excels.
With various stories on different characters, places, fantastical storylines and evil villains, the journey through fictional books can be one filled with adventure and excitement. The reader may be left with ideas that will serve in many areas. Fiction provides great scope for the mind to think creatively. In fact, many of books written to portray 'imaginary' events or characters can educate and send a subtle message through the book. This effective technique has been used successfully by a large number of writers. Yet it is true that many people cease to enjoy fiction, as they grow older failing to see its importance in the world. This perspective is not entirely untrue because dragons, castles or evil aliens will not help an engineer in any way as it might help him spend the same time by reading about how a particular bridge was constructed in Germany.

131.txt,"Sports have always been an unseperatable part of a schoolchild's life. But does it really do so much good after all? This is the topic we are going to talk about today.
First of all advantages, the most obvious one is probably the effect a moderate amount of exercise has on the child. Experience shows that children who exercise regularly are more attentive in class than children who never exercise. I remember that I felt a lot more concentrated in class when I was in fourth grade, when I was in a soccer team, than in fifth grade, when I dropped out and stopped exercising entirely. Exercise also has effects on a child's confidence, both in the means of shaping the child's body and giving the child a competition-conscious mind. For example, one of my best friends spent a lot of time on track when she was in primary school, ending up being among the tallest girls in school and having a somewhat superior feeling being able to run faster than anyone else.
But too much sport or improper guidance can be harmful. Being too involved usually ends up in the child feeling tired all the time or taking up too much time that was originally meant for study or play. Children can easily get too worked up in competitions and if this goes without steering, the child may develop wrong views towards winning and losing and life in general. It may also be harmful towards a child's body. Gymnastics, for instance, is known to be harsh towards the gymnasts, usually ending them up small and short. Many sports are dangerous, and children may be crippled when injured in the course of game.
So what attitude should we take up when we are facing such a question? As I see it, children's sports, despite the dangers, should be supported. After all, a moderate amount of sport is essential for a healthy child, and really getting involved in a sport can help build a child's reflexes, skills in sports in general, not to say the understanding of teamwork. So, spending lots of time on sports should be a good sign for young children. It means that these children are learning young what they will need to know all their lives.",0.9957,0.0043,HUMAN

Having friends who are similar to us would be beneficial in which we can enjoy things together and share the same opinion. With friends who are alike, we can always enjoy going to mutual enjoyable places together such as going to clubs or watching movies. For example, Gee and I have no problems on finding a place to eat every time we go out because we both enjoy eating and spend time at the local hawkers downtown. In addition, having friends of mutual interest would provide us with companion to share our opinion. I have a few friends who are similar to myself and I found that I could share my opinion with them on almost everything.

However, having friends who are different from us would have a few advantage of its own. People always say that, ""Opposite, attracts"". Friends who are different from us would be able to criticize and introduce us to something new and different. I realize that friends who are different from us would be able to criticize on our opinion. Of course, not all of our opinions are good.

Even though, neither jungle tracking nor sushi would be in my favorite list, it is fun and enjoyable to be able to experience such new things.

Primarily teachers are there for guidance in a particular field or subject. They give you a systematic and better way to approach a subject. A teacher normally teaches a subject in which he or she has expertise. Hence that person has made a study of the subject and can guide you in order to help you approach the subject in a better way. This guidance may be in the form of giving you names of reference books or giving you notes. Without a teacher it would be extremely cumbersome to go through large libraries for a certain topic. Besides this the teacher could provide you help with any sort of problem that you come across while studying. The teacher could provide you strategies that help you solve a problem. Without a teacher, this problem would take up a lot of your valuable time or remain unsolved. Teachers can also point out when you are going wrong. They point out our mistakes and suggest ways for us to correct them.
In the end it does depend on the individual person to finally getting down to learn a subject. The actual studying has to be done by the individual.

24.txt,"Nowadays, a lot of teens work in jobs while they are studying. Some of them really need the money they earn to compensate for their school expenses whereas others use the money they earn as pocket money. Whatever the reason for the students to work in jobs is, in my opinion, working is a great experience to all. Having a job is an important opportunity to learn about responsibilities and also teaches the teenagers to cooperate with their co-workers and enable them to understand the value of money.
To start with, working in a job gives teenagers lots of situations in which they should act responsibly; otherwise they will lose their jobs. For example, one has to wake up early if his/her working hours start at 8:00 AM in the morning, no matter how late he/she stayed up last night. Otherwise, his/her supervisor will warn him/her or may eventually fire the individual.
A second reason why having jobs as students has positive effects on teenagers is that it teaches them how to cooperate and the importance of cooperation. In a work setting usually the employees have to depend on each other on numerous occasions. When a single employee loafs, others will have to compensate for his/her workload in addition to their own tasks. Students will learn from their working experience the importance of cooperation and why every individual should effectively carry out his/her own work.
Another point is, these working possibilities enable the students to understand the value of money and that ""Money does not grow on trees"". After the student sees how hard he/she has to work to earn money, he/she will also be more reasonable while spending it, thus, his/her purchasing behavior will be enhanced.
In conclusion, when one has a job as a student, he/she will benefit significantly from the experience. This way, students will be more responsible when they graduate. Furthermore, they will be more cooperative, thus will be more beneficial for the companies they will be working in once they will be graduated. Finally, since they'll know better how to spend their money, they won't get into trouble due to excessive spending. All in all, having jobs as students is a terrific idea and I think every student should have a working experience before graduating and starting their professional careers.",0.9996,0.0004,HUMAN
